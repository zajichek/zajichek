The majority of small to midsize organizations don't have the resources or even the need for a full-time statistician, but they have valuable data assets that could be leveraged.

I use open source tools to build data products and conduct analysis. What this means for you? No overhead in the services, you are only paying for the time.

Whether you need help analyzing a dataset, want to learn statistics or R, 

Whether you're a business, organization, or individual, My mission is to serve as a resource for organizationsin Central Wisconsin and beyond to help solve problems with data.
