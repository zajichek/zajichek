Many organizations have data analysis needs, but lack the resources (or need) for full-time statisticians. My goal is to serve as a resource to individuals, businesses and organizations in Central Wisconsin and beyond for using data to address problems and build solutions. I use open source software tools for development and analysis which translates to less overhead and more focus on the problem at hand.
