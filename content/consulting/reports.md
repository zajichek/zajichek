A typical statistical analysis comes in the form of static or interactive documentation containing results with detailed descriptions, assumptions, annotations, and interpretations along with the supporting tables and figures. Using tools such as [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) gives the ability to produce these in a customized and reproducible way.
