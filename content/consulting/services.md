I use open source languages (R/Python) with the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) environment to enable flexibility to develop fully customized data products, transparency for code sharing and collaboration, and no overhead (it's free!). We can setup tools on the web with [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), static (or interactive) reports with [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), or I can send you the code to run on your own.
