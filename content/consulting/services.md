I use open source languages in the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) environment. This gives the flexibility to develop fully customized solutions and the transparency to collaborate and share code with no overhead. Processes can be setup to access solutions on the web, receive by e-mail, or code can be handed off to your team to implement and maintain in-house.
