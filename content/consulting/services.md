Whether you want to work together to build a data tool, need strategic advice for your statistical analysis, or just want to engage in a conversation about the problems you're working on, feel free to [reach out](/#contact). 

I use open source languages (R/Python) with the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) environment to enable flexibility to develop custom data products, transparency for code sharing and collaboration, and no overhead (it's free!). I like to build web tools with [R Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) and static/interactive reports with [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), but also enjoy developing functions and packages.
