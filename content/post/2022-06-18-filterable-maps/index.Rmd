_**In Progress**_

When you run `R` locally and don't have a server to process, how can you still deliver engaging analytic content?

Lately I've been spending a lot of time finding creative ways to deliver interactive and explorable analytic content to end-users in self-contained documents, without depending on a server to process the `R` code. There have been some incredible packages developed to help with this. Namely, two I focus on here are `leaflet` and `crosstalk`.

```{r}
require(tidyverse)
require(leaflet)
require(crosstalk)

state_outlines <-
  maps::map(
    database = "state",
    regions = "wisconsin",
    fill = TRUE,
    plot = FALSE
  )

  leaflet() %>%
  
  # Add geographic tiles
  addTiles() %>%
  
  # Add US state outlines
  addPolygons(
    data = state_outlines,
    fillColor = "gray",
    stroke = FALSE
  ) 
```
