summary: So you run `R` locally and don't have access to a runtime server, but want to be able to deliver engaging, interactive analytic content to your stakeholders. Is there a way to do that?

_**In Progress**_

Want to learn how to make a map widget like this one?

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}

### This junk builds the final map from start to finish

# Load packages
require(tidyverse)
require(leaflet)
require(crosstalk)

# Build the state outline
state_outlines <-
  maps::map(
    database = "state",
    regions = "wisconsin",
    fill = TRUE,
    plot = FALSE
  )

# Build the base map
leaflet() %>%
  
  # Add geographic tiles
  addTiles() %>%
  
  # Add US state outlines
  addPolygons(
    data = state_outlines,
    fillColor = "gray",
    stroke = FALSE
  ) 

```

So you run `R` locally and don't have access to a runtime server, but want to be able to deliver engaging, interactive analytic content to your stakeholders. Is there a way to do that? Lately, I've spent a lot of time learning and exploring tools to find the answer to that question. Luckily, the answer is _yes_, because there are many amazing packages that have been developed to help with this, including [`reactable`](https://glin.github.io/reactable/), [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/r/), [`DT`](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/), [`leaflet`](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/), and [`crosstalk`](https://rstudio.github.io/crosstalk/), among others. This article focuses on the latter two, and how we can build map widgets that are changeable by the user through filters, all in a self-contained HTML document.
