**__In Progress__**

In my [last post](https://www.zajichekstats.com/post/filterable-maps/) we demonstrated how to build a filterable map widget that was free of runtime dependency. In continuation of the latter theme, this article focuses on the [`reactable`](https://glin.github.io/reactable/) package, which allows for embedding interactive data tables into your HTML document. Specifically, we look into a few custom JavaScript functions needed to do commonly-desired aggregation.
