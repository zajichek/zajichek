<p><strong><strong>In Progress</strong></strong></p>
<p>In my <a href="https://www.zajichekstats.com/post/filterable-maps/">last post</a> we demonstrated how to build a filterable map widget that was free of runtime dependency. In continuation of the latter theme, this article focuses on the <a href="https://glin.github.io/reactable/"><code>reactable</code></a> package, which allows for embedding interactive data tables into your HTML document. Specifically, we look into a few custom JavaScript functions needed to do commonly-desired aggregation.</p>
