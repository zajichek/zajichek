<p>In my <a href="https://www.zajichekstats.com/post/filterable-maps/">last post</a> we demonstrated how to build a filterable map widget into an HTML output that was free of <code>R</code> runtime dependency. In continuation of that theme, this article focuses on the <a href="https://glin.github.io/reactable/"><code>reactable</code></a> package, which enables you to embed interactive data tables into your document. Specifically, we’ll look at how we can use its built-in JavaScript interface to define custom functions for commonly-desired aggregation and formatting.</p>

<h2>Make a summary dataset</h2>
<p>First we’ll need to create a data frame with group-level summary statistics that we want to display. For this example, we’ll look at the 30-day hospital readmission rate for heart failure patients on Medicare at the top five (5) most voluminous hospitals in a handful of Midwest states.</p>

<p>We get about what we’d expect: a basic, paginated table where each row from our dataset is represented verbatim. There are many things we could clean up here such as rounding, number representations, formatting, and, of course, aggregating the statistics to get state-specific readmission rates.</p>
</div>
<div id="builtinaggregation" class="section level2">
<h2>Built-in aggregation</h2>
<p>There are a number of <a href="#https://glin.github.io/reactable/articles/examples.html#grouping-and-aggregation">built-in aggregation functions</a> available to us by default. We just need to specify:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>The groups we want the aggregation applied within using the <code>groupBy</code> argument</li>
<li>The columns we want to aggregate, and how, using <code>colDef</code> within the <code>columns</code> argument</li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s add functionality to the table above to aggregate the <em>total</em> case count and the <em>average</em> 30-day readmission rate within each state.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>readmission_rates %&gt;%
  reactable(
    groupBy = &quot;State&quot;,
    columns = 
      list(
        Cases = colDef(aggregate = &quot;sum&quot;),
        `30-Day Readmission Rate` = colDef(aggregate = &quot;mean&quot;)
      )
  )</code></pre>

<p>The problem with this table is that the displayed state-level readmission rates represent the <em>averaged</em> rates across the individual hospitals. What we really want in the aggregation is for the hospital-specific rates to be weighted by their respective case volumes so that the state-level readmission rates are correct. This is where JavaScript comes in.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="jsinterface" class="section level1">
<h1>Using the JavaScript Interface</h1>
<p>During the call to <code>reactable</code>, our table is accessible through a JavaScript interface which makes it easy for us to customize the aggregation and formatting behavior when the default options won’t suffice. We can use the <code>JS</code> function from the <a href="https://www.htmlwidgets.org/"><code>htmlwidgets</code></a> package to:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Define a JavaScript function as a text string</li>
<li>Supply that function as the argument to <code>colDef</code> applicable to the function’s context</li>
</ol>
<div id="function1" class="section level2">
<h2>Function 1: Weighted mean</h2>
<p>Referring back to our <a href="#builtinaggregation">example</a>, we want to average the 30-day readmission rates over the hospitals within each state, but we need to weight them by their respective case volume. To do this, we can supply a custom JavaScript function to the <code>aggregate</code> argument. This function takes the entire vector of values within the group as its argument, as well as the group’s rows, and returns a scalar value. We can specify the column containing the case weights directly by name within the row.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>weighted_mean &lt;-
  function(weight) {
    JS(
      paste0(
        &quot;function(values, rows) {
          var numerator = 0
          var denominator = 0
    
          rows.forEach(function(row, index) {
            numerator += row[&#39;&quot;, weight, &quot;&#39;] * values[index]
            denominator += row[&#39;&quot;, weight, &quot;&#39;]
          })
    
          return numerator / denominator
  
        }&quot;
      )
    )
  }</code></pre>
<p>In our implementation, we encoded the <code>JS</code> function into an <code>R</code> function that calls for the weight column name so we can use it in any <code>reactable</code> in which we want this functionality applied. Let’s see what our table looks when we plug it in:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>readmission_rates %&gt;%
  reactable(
    groupBy = &quot;State&quot;,
    columns = 
      list(
        Cases = colDef(aggregate = &quot;sum&quot;),
        `30-Day Readmission Rate` = colDef(aggregate = weighted_mean(weight = &quot;Cases&quot;))
      )
  )</code></pre>
<div id="htmlwidget-3" class="reactable html-widget" style="width:auto;height:auto;"></div>
<script type="application/json" data-for="htmlwidget-3">{"x":{"tag":{"name":"Reactable","attribs":{"data":{"State":["IL","IL","IL","IL","IL","MI","MI","MI","MI","MI","MN","MN","MN","MN","MN","WI","WI","WI","WI","WI"],"Hospital":["NORTHSHORE UNIVERSITY HEALTHSYSTEM - EVANSTON HOSPITAL","PALOS COMMUNITY HOSPITAL","NORTHWESTERN MEMORIAL HOSPITAL","ADVOCATE CHRIST HOSPITAL & MEDICAL CENTER","NORTHWESTERN MEDICINE MCHENRY","BEAUMONT HOSPITAL ROYAL OAK","BEAUMONT HOSPITAL, TROY","ASCENSION PROVIDENCE HOSPITAL, SOUTHFIELD AND NOVI","TRINITY HEALTH ANN ARBOR HOSPITAL","SPECTRUM HEALTH","MAYO CLINIC HOSPITAL ROCHESTER","ABBOTT NORTHWESTERN HOSPITAL","PARK NICOLLET METHODIST HOSPITAL","MERCY HOSPITAL","MINNEAPOLIS VA MEDICAL CENTER","AURORA ST LUKES MEDICAL CENTER","FROEDTERT MEMORIAL LUTHERAN HOSPITAL","UNIVERSITY OF WI  HOSPITALS & CLINICS AUTHORITY","MERITER HOSPITAL","MILWAUKEE VA MEDICAL CENTER"],"Cases":[1968,1249,1146,1096,1029,1438,1401,1020,930,925,1273,632,590,589,546,1097,532,531,522,499],"30-Day Readmission Rate":[0.207,0.208,0.2,0.219,0.18,0.208,0.216,0.205,0.184,0.169,0.173,0.183,0.228,0.174,0.207,0.194,0.205,0.221,0.197,0.231]},"columns":[{"id":"State","name":"State","type":"character"},{"id":"Hospital","name":"Hospital","type":"character"},{"id":"Cases","name":"Cases","type":"numeric","aggregate":"sum"},{"id":"30-Day Readmission Rate","name":"30-Day Readmission Rate","type":"numeric","aggregate":"function(values, rows) {\n          var numerator = 0\n          var denominator = 0\n    \n          rows.forEach(function(row, index) {\n            numerator += row['Cases'] * values[index]\n            denominator += row['Cases']\n          })\n    \n          return numerator / denominator\n  \n        }"}],"groupBy":["State"],"dataKey":"d8d0c79a09cf612cadf658c3c29e83cb"},"children":[]},"class":"reactR_markup"},"evals":["tag.attribs.columns.3.aggregate"],"jsHooks":[]}</script>
<p>Now we have correctly calculated the state-level 30-day readmission rates.</p>
</div>
<div id="function2" class="section level2">
<h2>Function 2: Conditional coloring</h2>
<p>Suppose we would like to differentiate readmission rates in our table that are above or below the national average. To do this, we can define another JavaScript function and supply it to the <code>style</code> argument within <code>colDef</code>. First, lets pull in the comparison value.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>national_rate &lt;-
  read_csv(
    file = &quot;https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/sites/default/files/resources/6a36e0b7e124bc6f9afd036021cce397_1689206738/Unplanned_Hospital_Visits-National.csv&quot;,
    na = c(&quot;Not Available&quot;, &quot;Not Applicable&quot;)
  ) %&gt;%
  
  # Filter to the measure
  filter(
    `Measure ID` == &quot;READM_30_HF&quot;
  ) %&gt;%
  
  # Pull the rate
  pull(`National Rate`)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Warning: One or more parsing issues, call `problems()` on your data frame for details,
## e.g.:
##   dat &lt;- vroom(...)
##   problems(dat)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Rows: 14 Columns: 14
## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
## Delimiter: &quot;,&quot;
## chr (4): Measure ID, Measure Name, Start Date, End Date
## dbl (9): National Rate, Number of Hospitals Worse, Number of Hospitals Same,...

<pre class="r"><code>national_rate &lt;- national_rate / 100
national_rate</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.202</code></pre>
<p>Next, lets define another <code>JS</code> function wrapped in an <code>R</code> function that takes the column to evaluate, the comparison value, and the colors to fill in the table cell when it is above or below (or the same as) that threshold. These arguments will feed into the JavaScript function that applies the specified HTML styling to each value in the column.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>conditional_coloring &lt;-
  function(column, threshold, color_above, color_below, color_same = &quot;#fcfffd&quot;) {
    JS(
      paste0(
        &quot;function(rowInfo) {
          var value = rowInfo.row[&#39;&quot;, column, &quot;&#39;]
    
          if(value &gt; &quot;, threshold, &quot;) {
            var color = &#39;&quot;, color_above, &quot;&#39;
          } else if(value &lt; &quot;, threshold, &quot;) {
            var color = &#39;&quot;, color_below, &quot;&#39;
          } else {
            var color = &#39;&quot;, color_same, &quot;&#39;
          }
    
          return {background:color}
        }&quot;
      )
    )
  }</code></pre>
<p>We can now add it to the table:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>readmission_rates %&gt;%
  reactable(
    groupBy = &quot;State&quot;,
    columns = 
      list(
        Cases = colDef(aggregate = &quot;sum&quot;),
        `30-Day Readmission Rate` = 
          colDef(
            aggregate = weighted_mean(weight = &quot;Cases&quot;),
            style = 
              conditional_coloring(
                column = &quot;30-Day Readmission Rate&quot;,
                threshold = national_rate,
                color_above = &quot;#eb7554&quot;,
                color_below = &quot;#54a637&quot;
