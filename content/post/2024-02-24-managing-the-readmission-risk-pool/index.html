<p>Each year hospitals across the United States get <a href="https://www.cms.gov/medicare/payment/prospective-payment-systems/acute-inpatient-pps/hospital-readmissions-reduction-program-hrrp">penalized by CMS</a>, withholding up to 3% of all Medicare reimbursement for an entire fiscal year, for having excess <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/hospital-readmissions/">readmissions</a>. Additionally, readmissions get tied into payor incentives, quality programs, etc., and are a major part of the <a href="">value-based care</a> landscape (NEED SOME LINKS HERE). Thus, it has become a key focus area for hospitals in monitoring the overall health of their clinical and financial operations. Obviously, one of the main components of this focus is to figure out which interventions, processes and workflows to put in place in order to better prevent readmissions from occurring.</p>
<p>In this realm, there has historically been a large <a href="">body of work</a> trying to predict the likelihood of hospital readmission, in effort to intervene on high-risk patients at an earlier point in time. <a href="">Epic</a> even has <a href="">their own</a> readmission risk predictor native to its EHR platform that hospitals use for this very purpose. The issue I find with these models (and even the way CMS does it), is that they tend to evaluate the readmission risk for the patient at the <em>time of discharge</em>. That is, they only account for what occurred before or during the hospital stay to quantify the patientâ€™s risk. However, it is <a href="">well known</a>, and frankly just common sense, that the actual drivers of readmission are things that occur <em>after</em> the patient is discharged from the hospital.</p>
<p>Thus, it is my view that a reframing of the modeling problem is in order both from a risk quantification perspective, and for more actionable and intuitive analytics to inform practical, efficient, and tailored intervention to help the right patient at the right time.</p>
