Each year hospitals across the United States get [penalized by CMS](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/payment/prospective-payment-systems/acute-inpatient-pps/hospital-readmissions-reduction-program-hrrp), withholding up to 3% of all Medicare reimbursement for an entire fiscal year, for having excess [readmissions](https://www.healthcare.gov/glossary/hospital-readmissions/). Additionally, there are implications from [commericial payers](https://www.uhcprovider.com/content/dam/provider/docs/public/health-plans/medicare/MA-Readmission-Program-Clinical-Guidelines.pdf), [quality programs](https://www.ncqa.org/hedis/measures/plan-all-cause-readmissions/), etc. that make it a focal point of the general [value-based care](https://www.cms.gov/priorities/innovation/key-concepts/value-based-care#:~:text=What%20is%20value%2Dbased%20care,what%20an%20individual%20values%20most.) landscape. Not to mention the obvious patient burden (both financially and [psychologically](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34544571/)) of being hospitalized twice in a short period of time. Thus, it has become a [key area](https://www.definitivehc.com/blog/top-10-hospital-performance-metrics-you-need-to-know) of focus for hospitals in monitoring the overall health of their clinical and financial operations. 

In turn, the day-to-day discussion becomes one of strategy: what interventions, processes, and workflows should be put in place to proactively prevent hospital readmissions from occurring? This is not totally straightforward. Do we focus on preventing the _readmission_, or the initial hospitalization altogether? You can't have a readmission without an index stay. For which patients? Who needs which resources? There can be conflicting priorities. Hospitals _depend_ on admissions (mostly from [commercial payors](https://www.definitivehc.com/resources/healthcare-insights/breaking-down-us-hospital-payor-mixes)) to keep the lights on. Also, programs like the [HRRP](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/payment/prospective-payment-systems/acute-inpatient-pps/hospital-readmissions-reduction-program-hrrp) (CMS' penalty program) only apply to Medicare beneficiaries, which is a subset of the overall hospital population (and sometimes the [most unprofitable](https://www.aha.org/system/files/media/file/2020/09/fact-sheet-billing-explained-0820.pdf)). Should we just put our resources towards preventing admissions for the unprofitable patients? Probably not. Obviously, we are constrained morally (and legally (?)) from giving payor-based, preferential treatment, but this is simply the reality of the things stakeholders need to sift through. In my view, the best you can do to balance things, at least to start, is to be _meticulously aware_ of what is happening--through data.

In this realm, one component of particular interest is using [predictive analytics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predictive_analytics) to anticipate and intervene on high-risk patients in order to prevent a subsequent hospitalization. Despite there being a [large body of work](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=predicting+readmissions) by researchers developing creative and innovative approaches for preventing readmissions, the reality is (from my experience) that many hospitals probably do not leverage all the literature that is available because (a) most of it is just that--research, and it's difficult to confidently translate and tailor that to an actionable program for any one hospital, and (b) it is simply too difficult to parse and organize _because_ there is so much of it. 

So, when hospitals do go down the route of implementing predictive tools for readmissions, it seems to be more readily available, yet (in my opinion) sub-optimal modeling frameworks that are used. For example, [Epic](https://www.epic.com/) has [their own](https://www.epicshare.org/tips-and-tricks/use-predictive-risk-score-to-reduce-readmission) readmission risk predictor native to its EHR platform for this very purpose. The common thing I notice about these tools used in practice (and in the way [CMS does it](https://qualitynet.cms.gov/inpatient/measures/readmission)) is the modeling setup: they predict the likelihood of readmission based on the state of the patient at the _time of hospital discharge_. Yet, it is [well known](https://www.aha.org/system/files/2018-02/11sep-tw-readmissions.pdf), and frankly just common sense, that the actual drivers, like the real, preventable reasons, for a readmission are circumstances of the patient _after_ being discharged from the hospital. That's not to say these scores aren't _correlated_ with the rates of readmission, or can't provide a useful marker; but with the complexities of managing a diverse hospital population, it makes it difficult to figure out what to do with a rapidly stale risk score that only reflects how the patient was when they left the hospital.

Thus, it is my view that a reframing of the modeling problem is in order both from a risk quantification perspective, and for more actionable and intuitive analytics to inform practical, efficient, and tailored intervention to help the right patient at the right time.
