<p>Over time, I’ve found myself constantly learning new things or having new ideas, only to later forget them, then trying to relearn the same thing at a later date. So I thought it might be worthwhile to try to create a knowledge base for myself that I continually add to so that I can refer back when needed to maintain intuition. These might be little programming tricks, math and/or statistics concepts, general thoughts or ideas, etc.</p>
<p>I tried to derive the MLE for a set of Bernoulli responses just to see if I still could, and got stuck. The <em>probability mass function (PMF)</em> is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(Y_i = y) = p^y(1-p)^{1-y}\]</span>
First, we need to define the likelihood function:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[L(p) = \prod_{i=1}^nP(Y_i=y)\]</span>
Then, convert ot a log likelihood:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
log(L(p))
&amp;= log(\prod_{i=1}^nP(Y_i=y)) \\
&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^nlog(P(Y_i=y)) \\
&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^nlog(p^{y_i}(1-p)^{1-y_i}) \\
&amp;= log(p)\sum_{i=1}^ny_i + log(1-p)(n - \sum_{i=1}^ny_i)
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\]</span>
Next, we need to differentiate with respect to <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\frac{d}{dp}log(L(p))
&amp;= \frac{d}{dp} log(p)\sum_{i=1}^ny_i + log(1-p)(n - \sum_{i=1}^ny_i) \\
&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^ny_i \frac{d}{dp} log(p) + (n - \sum_{i=1}^ny_i) \frac{d}{dp} log(1-p) \\
&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^ny_i \frac{1}{p} + (n - \sum_{i=1}^ny_i) \frac{1}{1-p} \frac{d}{dp} (1-p) \\
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\]</span>
This is where my problem was. I forgot about the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_rule">chain rule</a> when taking a derivative, so I wasn’t doing the additional step of taking multiplying by the derivative of <span class="math inline">\(1-p\)</span>, thus things weren’t cancelling appropriately when solving for <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>. It should reduce to:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sum_{i=1}^ny_i \frac{1}{p} + (n - \sum_{i=1}^ny_i) \frac{-1}{1-p}\]</span>
Finally, we just set that equal to zero:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\sum_{i=1}^ny_i \frac{1}{p} + (n - \sum_{i=1}^ny_i) \frac{-1}{1-p} = 0\]</span>
After some algebra:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\hat{p} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^ny_i}{n}\]</span></p>
