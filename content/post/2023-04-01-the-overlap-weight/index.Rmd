I was recently introduced to a new method in the field of [matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matching_(statistics)) for observational studies called [_overlap weighting_](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2765748). Although I've just started getting into the details, I already see it as superior to [propensity score (PS) matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_score_matching), a well-known matching method and what I've typically done in the past, for a few reasons (that I've observed at least):

1. It uses all available information (all observations) instead of arbitrary cutoffs like, for example, 1:5 matching 
2. It's properties _force_ the standardized differences of all factors included in the propensity score model to be zero across the treatment groups
3. Each treatment group contributes equally to outcome model when the overlap weights are used regardless of the balance of the two in the original sample
4. Because of (1), it makes it much more intuitive to explore the impacts of the weighting process on other covariates and the outcome

The _overlap weighting_ process actually starts the same as _PS matching_--by modeling the treatment group as a function of various factors that may be confounding the observed (unadjusted) treatment effect. It's what is done will the scores (probabilities) that differentiate the methods. 

* How to calculate them
* Intuition about who it focuses on, proportional down weights
* Show differences in outcome weighted and unweighted
* Show standarized differences of covariates (some not included in PS model as well) (use plotly)
* Show ways to assess cumulative contribution of cases and impact on other covariates
* Assess redundancy
