<p><strong><em>In progress</em></strong></p>
<p>I was recently introduced to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2765748">overlap weighting</a>, which is part of a general family of methods for balancing covariates when estimating treatment effects with observational data. Specifically, it focuses on the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/clinical-equipoise#:~:text=Clinical%20equipoise%20is%20defined%20as,Seminars%20in%20Vascular%20Surgery%2C%202022"><em>clinical equipoise</em></a>; that is, the patients in which the treatment decision is most uncertain. I find it more elegant than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propensity_score_matching">matching</a> (which I’ve <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2749478">used in the past</a>), and figured a useful way to better understand the approach is to deconstruct, interpret, and translate a <a href="http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~fl35/OW/OW_survival_Demo.sas">SAS simulation</a> in the context of survival analysis implemented by the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30189042/">original authors</a>. All code is written in (and translated to) <a href="https://www.r-project.org/"><code>R</code></a>. We’ll start by loading some packages.</p>

<h1>Setting up the potential outcomes</h1>
<p>The theoretical underpinnings of <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30189042/">overlap weighting</a> live in the context of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5841618/#:~:text=The%20potential%20outcomes%20framework%20provides%20a%20way%20to%20quantify%20causal,exposure%20or%20intervention%20under%20consideration.">potential outcomes</a> paradigm of <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/social-sciences/causal-inference">causal inference</a>. Basically, we wonder what <em>would have</em> happened had we been able to observe each patient under both treatments (known as the <a href="https://bmcmedresmethodol.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2288-5-28">counterfactual</a>). If we knew the outcomes from the two worlds, the causal treatment effect would simply be the average difference across all patients. The problem of course is that in reality the outcome can only be observed for the treatment in which the patient was assigned (or chose), and so our goal is to work with the “incomplete” information that we do have to try to estimate what the outcome difference would have been had the counterfactual been observed as well.</p>
<div id="simulatepatients" class="section level2">
<h2>Simulate some patients</h2>
<p>The first thing we need to do is generate some (fake) patients to facilitate the simulation. Here we’ll focus on age, sex, and income as patient-identifying characteristics.</p>

<p>We’ve generated a sample of 10000 patients. We’ll assume <code>age</code> is measured in years, <code>income</code> in thousands of dollars ($), and <code>male</code> is 1 for <em>Male</em> and 0 for <em>Female</em>. The columns <code>zage</code> and <code>zincome</code> are just <a href="https://statisticsbyjim.com/glossary/standardization/#:~:text=In%20statistics%2C%20standardization%20is%20the,standard%20deviation%20for%20a%20variable.">standardized</a> versions of the originals to avoid scaling nuances (we’ll refer to these as <span class="math inline">\(age_z\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(income_z\)</span>).</p>
</div>
<div id="treatmentpropensity" class="section level2">
<h2>Define the treatment propensity</h2>
<p>Here’s where the important theory starts to creep in (already). We assume that there is a <em>true</em> propensity score, say <span class="math inline">\(p_i^A\)</span>, that is the <em>true</em> probability that patient <em>i</em> receives treatment <em>A</em> given their specific characteristics (and let’s assume there are possible treatments <em>A</em> &amp; <em>B</em>). Further, we assume (some transformation of) this probability is some linear combination of all the characteristics that confound the crude treatment effect on the outcome. In this simulation, we’ll assume the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">logit</a> model:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[log(\frac{p_i^A}{1 - p_i^A}) = -0.4 + 0.405*age_z - 0.223*male - 0.693*income_z\]</span></p>
<p>So let’s add this <em>true</em> propensity score to the <code>population</code> data set:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>population &lt;-
  population |&gt;
  
  # Add the true propensity score (unknown quantity)
  mutate(
    log_odds_pA = -0.4 + log(1.5)*zage + log(0.8)*male + log(.50)*zincome,
    pA = 1 / (1 + exp(-log_odds_pA))
  )
population</code></pre>

<p>Obviously in practice we don’t know what <span class="math inline">\(p_i^A\)</span> is, so it must be <em>estimated</em> from the treatment assignments we observe in the data. Additionally, we aren’t strictly required to assume the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression">logit</a> model, but when we use it to estimate the propensity score for <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30189042/">overlap weighting</a>, it has the advantageous property of perfect balance. That is, the weighted-mean differences for all covariates included in the logistic regression model will be zero across the treatment groups.</p>
</div>
<div id="treatmentassignment" class="section level2">
<h2>Generate the treatment assignment</h2>
<p>The treatment assignment is one of the <em>known</em> quantities we would observe in a real life sample, and that is what would be used as the dependent variable for <em>estimating</em> propensity scores. However, since we are running a simulation, we need to generate the treatment assignments from the governing distribution. We assume that the observed treatment for patient <em>i</em> is the result of an (unfair) coin flip that has a probability equal to the <a href="#treatmentpropensity">true propensity score</a>. In math notation,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[A_i \sim Bernoulli(p_i^A)\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> is the indicator of treatment A. Let’s add a <em>realized</em> treatment assignment to the <code>population</code>:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>population &lt;-
  population |&gt;
  
  # Add the realized treatment assignment (known quantity)
  mutate(
    A = rbinom(n, size = 1, prob = pA),
  )

<p>In this case, <code>A=1</code> represents treatment <em>A</em> and <code>A=0</code> represents treatment <em>B</em>. Again, this is the actual treatment we would observe the patient receiving in a sample.</p>
</div>
<div id="trueoverlapweight" class="section level2">
<h2>Compute the (true) overlap weight</h2>
<p>We need to define what the overlap weight is, and it’s actually quite simple: just assign the patient the probability they <em>did not</em> receive their observed treatment.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\begin{equation}
OW_i=
    \begin{cases}
        1-p_i^A &amp; \text{if } A_i=1\\
        p_i^A &amp; \text{if } A_i=0\\
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
\]</span></p>
<p>Notice the notation. Since it depends on the <a href="#treatmentpropensity">true propensity score</a>, the overlap weight is another <em>unknown</em> quantity that is estimated from the data. It also depends on the <a href="#treatmentassignment">realized treatment assignment</a>, so the collection of weights across patients differ depending on the observed treatment distribution. We can add these weights to the <code>population</code> data set:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>population &lt;-
  population |&gt;
  
  # Add the true overlap weight for the realized treatment (unknown quantity)
  mutate(
    OW = A * (1-pA) + (1-A) * pA

<p>In a real analysis, these weights are what we are ultimately after in order to estimate the average <em>causal</em> treatment effect on the outcome of interest while balancing differences in patient characteristics across the groups (i.e., removing the confounding factors).</p>
<div id="target-population" class="section level3">
<h3>Target population</h3>
<p>Now we do end up normalizing the weights so they sum to one within each treatment group. But the intuition about what’s happening is that the focus of the treatment effect estimation is shifted to patients that are most likely in <em>either</em> treatment group (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(p_i^A\)</span> near 0.5). This is known as the <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/medicine-and-dentistry/clinical-equipoise#:~:text=Clinical%20equipoise%20is%20defined%20as,Seminars%20in%20Vascular%20Surgery%2C%202022"><em>clinical equipoise</em></a>, and the resulting treatment effect is interpreted as the <em>average treatment effect in the overlap population</em>.</p>
<p>This makes a lot of sense. When we’re comparing treatments, we should focus most heavily on patients that could be candidates for either, and less so on patients that were bound for one. Thus, we up-weight patients who have the most overlap in characteristics with the opposing treatment group. The beautiful thing here is that we do this without throwing away any information; smoothly and proportionately weighting each subject just the amount that we should.</p>

<h1>Resources</h1>
<p>The overlap weight is part of a general class of causal methodology/theory for balancing covariates to estimate treatment effects using propensity scores. More broadly, these fall into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubin_causal_model"><em>potential outcomes</em></a> framework of causal inference, which I happened to be introduced to by accident while learning about overlap weighting from these resources:</p>
<ul>
<li>Original paper for overlap weighting (<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30189042/">link</a>)</li>
<li>Paper extending overlap weighting to survival analysis (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.04394">link</a>)</li>
<li>Example simulation of overlap weighting in the survival setting in SAS (<a href="http://www2.stat.duke.edu/~fl35/OW/OW_survival_Demo.sas">link</a>)</li>
<li>R package for implementing overlap weight methods (<a href="https://github.com/thuizhou/PSweight">link</a>)</li>
<li>R functions for overlap weighting in the survival setting (<a href="https://github.com/chaochengstat/OW_Survival">link</a>)</li>
<li>Author’s web page dedicated to overlap weighting (<a href="https://www2.stat.duke.edu/~fl35/OW.html">link</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>All of these were super helpful. Understanding the idea of potential outcomes made the math and methodological concepts a lot easier to grasp conceptually and gain intuition. The way I like to think about it is (roughly) in the following order:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Each observation has a <em>true</em> propensity score (probability of treatment). The treatment we observe is just a realization of a random draw from that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernoulli_distribution">Bernoulli</a> distribution (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_distribution">Multinomial</a> distribution if there are more treatments). We must estimate this from the treatment we observe.</li>
<li>Since there is a true propensity score, there is also a <em>true</em> overlap weight (for each treatment option) that balances the observations back with the population. We must also estimate this from the data.</li>
<li>The outcome we observe is conditional on the observed treatment. So there exists some true function (e.g., linear predictor) relating the observation to the outcome under the treatment we observed.</li>
<li>However, this also all exists for the treatment(s) we did <em>NOT</em> observe. So there are analogous functions relating the observation to the outcome under the alternate treatment scenarios.</li>
<li>If we could observe the outcome for all treatments, we could just compute the mean differences in the outcome across the treatment groups and that would be the causal treatment effect. I imagine a stacked data set where there is a row for each observation under each treatment, it’s just that the the outcome value (and other data) for the treatments that weren’t observed are missing, and our goal is to estimate what the mean differences in the outcomes would have been had that data not been missing. Thus we must use what we have to approximate that.</li>
</ol>
