<p><em>Quantum entanglement</em> is an intimidating phrase to encounter when you barely know what <em>quantum</em> means (and maybe it is even if you do). My daughter’s book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Quantum-Entanglement-Babies-Baby-University/dp/1492656232"><em>Quantum Entanglement for Babies</em></a>, also does a good job of keeping the mystery alive:</p>
<p><img src="QEPage.png" /></p>
<p>Now I’ve just barely scratched the surface in quantum computing (and I mean <em>barely</em>, like I’ve gotten so far as to understand how to build a circuit to add two bits together. Yes, 1 + 1 = 2). But as I was going through the section on quantum entanglement in <a href="https://github.com/Qiskit/textbook/tree/main/notebooks/intro">this tutorial</a>, I immediately noticed something familiar that it was getting at (albeit in an unfamiliar, roundabout way). And that was <em>statistical independence</em>.</p>
<div id="some-background" class="section level1">
<h1>Some background</h1>
<p>We can represent the state of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qubit"><em>qubits</em></a> (like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit"><em>bit</em></a>, but in quantum), at a given point in time, as <em>state vectors</em>, which (loosely) correspond to the probability they will be measured in a particular state.</p>
<p>For example, suppose we have a qubit, <span class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span>, that has the following state vector:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[q_0 = |0\rangle = \left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \\ \end{array}\right]\]</span></p>
<p>The <em>positions</em> of the vector represent the possible states the qubit can be in. Namely, since it’s basically just a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit">bit</a>, 0 (position 1) or 1 (position 2). The <em>entries</em> in the vector represent (again, loosely) the probability that the qubit will take on that state when measured. So in this example,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(q_0 = 0) = 1 \hskip.1in P(q_0=1)=0\]</span>
It will <em>always</em> be measured in the 0 state.</p>
<p>Now suppose we introduce another qubit, <span class="math inline">\(q_1\)</span>. And remember, computers just store information as sequences of bits. This qubit can also only be measured in states 0 or 1. Thus, the possible <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code">bit strings</a> are:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th><span class="math inline">\(q_1q_0\)</span></th>
<th>Represents the number…</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>00</td>
<td><span class="math inline">\((0\times2^1) + (0 \times 2^0) = 0\)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>01</td>
<td><span class="math inline">\((0\times2^1) + (1 \times 2^0) = 1\)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>10</td>
<td><span class="math inline">\((1\times2^1) + (0 \times 2^0) = 2\)</span></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>11</td>
<td><span class="math inline">\((1\times2^1) + (1 \times 2^0) = 3\)</span></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>So one possible two-qubit state vector is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[|01\rangle = \left[\begin{array}{c} 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ \end{array}\right]\]</span></p>
<p>where, again, the <em>positions</em> represent the possible sequences of qubits (00, 01, 10, 11; there will always be <span class="math inline">\(2^n\)</span> possible states, where <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is the number of qubits), and the entries (for the third time, loosely) represent the probability of measuring that sequence. In this case,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(q_0 = 1 \cap q_1 = 0) = 1; \hskip.1in P(\text{other combos}) = 0\]</span>
So now we can imagine the more interesting case where more than one entry is non-zero, that is, multiple different states have a positive probability of being measured. Given it still has to lead to a valid probability distribution, this means that the 100% must be distributed amongst the possibilities.</p>
<p>The final thing I’ll leave here is that the entries actually represent the <em>square root</em> of the probability, which is why I’ve been emphasizing probability “loosely”. So the “valid probability distribution” constraint applies to the <em>square</em> of the vector entries. In the first example above, a more complete way to write this would be:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(q_0 = 0) = 1^2 = 1 \hskip.1in P(q_0=1) = 0^2 = 0\]</span></p>

<div id="what-is-entanglement" class="section level1">
<h1>What is entanglement?</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/Qiskit/textbook/blob/main/notebooks/intro/entangled-states.ipynb">tutorial</a> has us consider a couple of two-qubit state vectors:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[|\Phi^+\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ \end{array}\right] \hskip.2in |+0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ \end{array}\right]\]</span></p>
<p>If we let <span class="math inline">\(X = q_1q_0\)</span>, that is, the bit string measured from the qubits, these imply the following:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P_{|\Phi^+\rangle}(X = 00) = P_{|\Phi^+\rangle}(X = 11) = \frac{1}{2}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P_{|+0\rangle}(X = 00) = P_{|+0\rangle}(X = 10) = \frac{1}{2}\]</span></p>
<p>Notice how both bits change in <span class="math inline">\(|\Phi^+\rangle\)</span>, but only one changes in <span class="math inline">\(|+0\rangle\)</span>. The former is <em>entangled</em>, the latter is not. This is because we cannot separate <span class="math inline">\(|\Phi^+\rangle\)</span> into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_superposition">superpositions</a> of two individual, one-qubit state vectors. But in <span class="math inline">\(|+0\rangle\)</span>, we can:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[q_0 = \left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 0 \\ \end{array}\right] = |0\rangle\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[q_1 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \left[\begin{array}{c} 1 \\ 1 \\ \end{array}\right] = |+\rangle\]</span></p>
<p>Implying that <span class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span> will always be measured to 0, and all uncertainty (random variability) lies in measuring <span class="math inline">\(q_1\)</span>. This is known as a <em>product</em> state, because the probabilities in the two-qubit state vector can be determined by a cross-product of the individual ones.</p>
</div>
<div id="its-just-independence" class="section level1">
<h1>It’s just independence</h1>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independence_(probability_theory)">Statistical independence</a> occurs when the probability of observing an event does not change once we know something about another one. In our case, we can pretty clearly see this holds for <span class="math inline">\(|+0\rangle\)</span> but not <span class="math inline">\(|\Phi^+\rangle\)</span>. Let’s look at the latter case.</p>
<p>From the the two-qubit state vector, we know the possible measurements are 00 or 11. Thus,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P_{|\Phi^+\rangle}(q_0 = 0) = P_{|\Phi^+\rangle}(q_0 = 1) = \frac{1}{2}\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[P_{|\Phi^+\rangle}(q_1 = 0) = P_{|\Phi^+\rangle}(q_1 = 1) = \frac{1}{2}\]</span></p>
<p>Marginally, each qubit has an equal chance of being measured 0 or 1. But once we know something about the state of the other qubit, this changes:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P_{|\Phi^+\rangle}(q_1 = 0|q_0 = 0) = 1\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[P_{|\Phi^+\rangle}(q_1 = 0|q_0 = 1) = 0\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[P_{|\Phi^+\rangle}(q_1 = 1|q_0 = 0) = 0\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[P_{|\Phi^+\rangle}(q_1 = 1|q_0 = 1) = 1\]</span></p>
<p>We could flip those around and condition <span class="math inline">\(q_0\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(q_1\)</span> and we’d end up with the same result. What this shows is that in the entangled state,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(q_0|q_1) \neq P(q_0)\]</span>
implying</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(q_0 \cap q_1) \neq P(q_0)P(q_1)\]</span></p>
<p>and therefore are not independent. Once we know (measure) one qubit, we automatically know what the other one will be. If you go through the same math for <span class="math inline">\(|+0\rangle\)</span>, you’ll see the marginal and conditional probabilities are in fact equal, and thus independent.</p>
<p>Now I don’t know if/how this might change once you start introducing more qubits or allow for the full range of <a href="https://github.com/Qiskit/textbook/blob/main/notebooks/intro/what-is-quantum.ipynb">phase</a>, but to keep things intuitive, my working definition of quantum entanglement is:</p>
<p><strong><em>Does the probability of a qubit being measured to particular state depend on the state of another qubit? If yes, they are entangled; otherwise, they are not.</em></strong></p>
