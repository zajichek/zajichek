<p><span class="math display">\[\Large \it \text {In Progress}\]</span>
A few years ago I encountered an interesting count distribution at work during a modeling project. The goal was to model the number of <a href="https://www.shoulderdoc.co.uk/article/538">suture anchors</a> used in rotator-cuff tendon tears, and how that was influenced by tear characteristics and surgeon preference. My instinct would typically be to fit a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_distribution">Poisson</a> model, but the target took on relatively small values and was also non-zero, so I had to do some digging for an alternative approach. I came across a method called Conway-Maxwell (COM) Poisson regression, which not only allowed for <em>overdispersion</em> (i.e., the population variance is greater than its mean), but also <em>underdispersion</em>. It hit me that I had never come across methodology for the latter and it seemed to align with my problem, so I was intrigued (FD: I heard of COM-Poisson prior to that, albeit knew nothing about it, when one of my super smart graduate school buddies was doing research on it, so that‚Äôs also why it stuck).</p>
<p>Long story short, we didn‚Äôt end up using the COM-Poisson model for the <a href="https://www.jshoulderelbow.org/article/S1058-2746(18)30555-X/fulltext">anchor project</a> üòÅ, and instead went in favor of <a href="https://stats.oarc.ucla.edu/r/dae/zero-truncated-poisson/">Zero-Truncated Poisson regression</a>. Nevertheless I thought it was an awesome method that warranted further exploration and later did a <a href="NonTraditionalCountRegression.pdf">talk</a> on it. That was a few years ago‚Äìso this article is intended to be a reworking of that talk to relearn it for myself, but also to get the word out about this awesome method!</p>

<h1>A review of Poisson regression</h1>
<p>I really like making up examples, so lets start with that:</p>
<p>Suppose hospital administrators are interested in emergency department (ED) utilization and have asked two specific questions:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>How many patients can we expect to see in a single day?</li>
<li>What is the likelihood that we see more than 40 patients in a single day?</li>
</ol>
<p>To expedite the process, we‚Äôre given a pre-built dataset called <code>ed_volumes</code> containing the number of patients entering the ED each day over the past year.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Load some packages
require(tidyverse)

# Check the dataset
print(ed_volumes, n = 5)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## # A tibble: 365 x 2
##   Date       Volume
##   &lt;date&gt;      &lt;int&gt;

## 5 2022-01-06     41

<p>First, let‚Äôs take a look at the distribution of patient volume over the time period:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ed_volumes %&gt;%

      y = 41,
      label = str_c(&quot;Avg: &quot;, round(mean(Volume), 1), &quot; patients&quot;)
    ),
    color = &quot;#b84f48&quot;,
    hjust = -.15

<p>There were 29.1 patients per day on average, and the volume ranged from 11 to 51. Knowing that this is a count distribution, we think to use a Poisson model to provide our estimates. Let‚Äôs remind ourselves the specifics of a Poisson random variable:</p>
<p>If the probability mass function (PMF) for a non-negative, integer-valued <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(Y = y|\lambda) = \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^y}{y!}\]</span>
then <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is distributed as a Poisson random variable, and has the following property:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E[Y] = \lambda\]</span>
It turns out that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is the <a href="https://www.statlect.com/fundamentals-of-statistics/Poisson-distribution-maximum-likelihood">sample average</a>. Remembering this, <em>we provide the estimate for the first question to be 29 patients.</em></p>
<pre class="r"><code>lambda_hat &lt;- mean(ed_volumes$Volume)
lambda_hat</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 29.08219</code></pre>
<p>We also know that once we have an estimate for <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> that we can compute probabilities by plugging it into the PMF:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(Y&gt;40) = 1 - P(Y\leq40) = 1 - \sum_{y=0}^{40} \frac{e^{-\lambda}\lambda^y}{y!}\]</span></p>
<pre class="r"><code>y &lt;- 0:40
p &lt;- exp(-lambda_hat) * lambda_hat^y / factorial(y)
question2 &lt;- 1 - sum(p)
question2</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.0213487</code></pre>
<pre class="r"><code># Alternative approach
1- ppois(40, lambda_hat)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## [1] 0.0213487</code></pre>
<p><em>We estimate that there is a 2.1% chance that we will see more than 40 patients in the ED in a single day</em>‚Äìwe‚Äôre done!</p>
<p>üò®</p>
<p>Unfortunately, after we handed off the results, we realized that we missed a crucial assumption about the Poisson distribution:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[E[Y] = Var[Y]\]</span>
Our estimates assumed that the mean and variance of our underlying distribution were equal, but we failed to check this assumption. The sample variance was 46.9 which is considerably larger than the mean of 29.1.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we remembered something the hospital administrators passively hypothesized during the consultation: they think the ED is less busy on the weekends than during the week.</p>
<p>Namely, the population average number of events is equal to its variance which is a crucial assumption. Here is a look at the distribution of a number of simulated Poisson random variables for increasing <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>:</p>

<p>For small <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, <strong>Y</strong> takes on a relatively small number of (small) values and appears right-skewed. As <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> increases, the distribution becomes much more symmetric and ‚Äúorganized‚Äù, partially because the standard deviation is decreasing relative to the mean.</p>
<div id="how-does-the-regression-model-work" class="section level2">
<h2>How does the regression model work?</h2>
<p>Just like other <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_linear_model">generalized linear models</a> (GLM), in a Poisson regression model, we want to estimate the population average (the same average as described above), but conditioned on a given set of covariates.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a collection of covariates <span class="math inline">\(x_1, x_2, .., x_p\)</span>, then we can assume the following functional form:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[log(\lambda_i) = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_{i1} + \beta_2x_{i2}+...+\beta_px_{ip}\]</span>
This <em>log-linear</em> model then allows us to estimate the average number of events (i.e., the Poisson parameter) for a given arrangement of covariate values. We also get informative interpretation of the individual effects of each covariate. For example, if we look at the resulting <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> estimation for increasing <span class="math inline">\(x_1\)</span> by 1 unit, assuming all other covariates are the same, we get:</p>
<p>$$$$</p>
<p>$$$$</p>
<p>To estimate the parameters, we can plug this equation into the Poisson PMF:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[P(Y_i = y_i|\lambda_) \]</span></p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is large, it can be reasonable to get away with a ordinary least-squares model.</p>
