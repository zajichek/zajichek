Hi, I'm Alex, a statistician and data scientist in Central Wisconsin. I have a passion for applying statistics to building and implementing data tools and analyses to help individuals and business stakeholders make data-informed decisions, particularly in the context of health system/clinical operations. I'm an advocate for practicing data science using open source languages such as R and Python, specifically in the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) environment. I thoroughly enjoy the entire life cycle of a data project, from defining/scoping the problem, wrangling the data, building a model/analysis, and disseminating the results, and am always up for learning, discussing, and debating statistical methodologies. The intention of this website is to serve as a repository for content and projects related to statistics and data science that I find interesting.
