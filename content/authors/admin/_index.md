Hi, I'm Alex, a data scientist and statistician in Central Wisconsin. I have a passion for building and implementing data products (in the form of models, analyses, reports, web applications, etc.) to help individuals and business stakeholders get the most out of their data and empower them to make the best decisions possible. I prefer and advocate for practicing data science using open source languages such as R and Python, specifically in the [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) environment. I thoroughly enjoy the entire life cycle of a data science project from defining/scoping the problem, wrangling the data, building a model/analysis, and disseminating the results, and am always up for learning, discussing, and debating statistical methodologies. The intention of this website is to serve as a repository for content and projects related to statistics and data science that I find interesting.
