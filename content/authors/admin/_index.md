I'm a statistician and data scientist in Central Wisconsin. A heavy [R](https://www.r-project.org/)-user and advocate for open-source development, I like to build data tools, analyses and products that can help facilitate the decision-making process. I have an interest in seeing a thriving analytics community in Central Wisconsin, and enjoy learning about area businesses and identifying opportunities to develop rigorous yet practical data science solutions that promote action. I'm always open to collaboration and discussion, so feel free to [reach out](/#contact)!
