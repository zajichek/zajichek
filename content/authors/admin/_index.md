I'm a statistician and data scientist in Central Wisconsin. I have a passion for building data science solutions that are useful, practical, and make people's lives easier. I love learning about the problems that businesses and organizational stakeholders face, including all of the nuances, translating them into technical requirements, and then executing to build tangible, measurable data products. I'm a heavy [R](https://www.r-project.org/)-user and an advocate for open-source tools for data science as they promote collaboration, transparency, flexibility, and they're free.
