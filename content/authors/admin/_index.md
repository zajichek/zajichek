<p style = "font-size: 11px;"><em>(Last name pronounced "Zy-check")</em></p>

I'm a biostatistician and data scientist in Central Wisconsin with an interest in seeing a thriving analytics community in the area. A heavy [R](https://www.r-project.org/)-user and advocate for open-source research & development, I like to build data tools, analyses and products that can help facilitate healthcare decision-making processes. I'm always open to collaboration and discussion, so feel free to [reach out](/#contact)!
