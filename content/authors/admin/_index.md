<p style = "font-size: 11px;"><em>(Last name pronounced "Zy-check")</em></p>

I'm a statistician and data scientist in Central Wisconsin. A heavy [R](https://www.r-project.org/) user and advocate for open-source development, I like to build data tools, models and analyses that can help facilitate decision-making processes. I'm always open to collaboration and discussion, so feel free to [reach out](/#contact)!
