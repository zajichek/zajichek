In the foreword of [Jordan Peterson](https://www.jordanbpeterson.com/)'s, [_"12 Rules of Life: An Antidote to Chaos"_](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345816021) (page _xxi_), it states:

> "_Modern_ moral relativism has many sources. As we in the West learned more history, we understood that different epochs had different moral codes. As we travelled the seas and explored the globe, we learned of far-flung tribes on different continents whose different moral codes made sense relative to, or within the framework of, their societies. Science played a role, too, by attacking the religious grounds for ethics and rules. Materialist social science implied that we could divide the world into facts (which all could observe, and were objective and "real") and values (which were subjective and personal). Then we could first agree on the facts, and, maybe, one day, develop a scientific code of ethics (which has yet to arrive). Moreover, by implying that values had a lesser reality than facts, science contributed in yet another way to moral relativism, for it treated "value" as secondary. **(But the idea that we can easily separate facts and values was and remains naive; to some extent, one's values determine what one will pay attention to, and what will count as a fact.)**" - Dr. Norman Doidge, MD

I could just end it here, because that quote just about encapsulates my entire reasoning for the title of this article. But since I have more to say on it, and would like to more explicitly relate this to statistics, I'll proceed. 

# An empty phrase

The term "data-driven", meant to mean..., is flashy and meant to show modernity and part of the "informed" crowd, is actually meaningless and doesn't make any sense. Information is data, and information is infinitely everywhere, all the time. If you were just driven by data you'd be like a leaf blowing in the wind, no direction, never getting anywhere. The most charitable interpretation still means that utilitarianism is key, still no solid footing.

But this isn't how anyone consumes information. We pay attention to the things we care about, and ignore the things we don't. We have subjective thresholds of tolerance for what different information implies about what we should do and how we should act. The direction of something is and can never be determined by the data.

Thus, this all must be backed by some sort of value-based foundation that guides what's important.

* You're "data-driven" because you use data to drive your business? Wrong. You care about money and that's the value.

# Statistics

* We don't wait to see 
* We can infer and anticipate what the value of certain outcomes would be. Yes, we wait until the experiment is over to _inform_ the realized path we should take, but we're not just on a whim

* The bold part at the end, in particular, perfectly encapsulates the reason for why I think being "data-driven" makes no sense at all, despite it being a popular phrase to show sophistication or superiority. 

* It is also the precise, fundamental reason for the long standing issues with statistical significance as a whole and why it is meaningless

* Short of complete utilitarianism, data-driven doesn't make any sense.

  + Huberman podcast he does
  + Also one of the main points of We Who Wrestle with God

* Light of the Mind, Light of the World similar theme

* Show table/dataset of random data with no context
* Add context to it to show meaning
* Add another context with same data to show that the VALUE of it has now changed
