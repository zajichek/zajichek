See the package website [here](https://centralstatz.github.io/readmit/index.html)._\n\n`readmit` is an evolving R package that contains tools for working with and analyzing hospital readmissions data. Currently, it provides utilities for components of the [Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP)](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/payment/prospective-payment-systems/acute-inpatient-pps/hospital-readmissions-reduction-program-hrrp), including program timeline functions, [Hospital-Specific Report (HSR)](https://qualitynet.cms.gov/inpatient/hrrp/reports) helpers, and general importing tools for the [Provider Data Catalog (PDC)](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/).\n\n## Installation\n\nYou can install `readmit` from CRAN:\n\n``` r\n# install.packages(\"pak\")\ninstall.packages(\"readmit\")\n```\n\nOr the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:\n\n``` r\n# install.packages(\"pak\")\npak::pak(\"centralstatz/readmit\")\n```\n\n# Background\n\nA _readmission_ occurs when a patient is admitted to the hospital, again, after they were recently discharged (where 30 days is the typical time frame used between hospitalizations). First and foremost, it is an obvious burden to patients for multiple reasons (i.e., psychologically, financially, etc.). \n\nAdditionally, hospitals across the United States are [penalized](https://qualitynet.cms.gov/inpatient/hrrp/methodology) by the [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)](https://www.cms.gov/) on an annual basis in what is called the [Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP)](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/payment/prospective-payment-systems/acute-inpatient-pps/hospital-readmissions-reduction-program-hrrp). In this program, up to 3% of Medicare reimbursement is witheld from hospitals for the duration of a [fiscal year](https://www.usa.gov/federal-budget-process) depending on the volume of [excess readmissions](https://qualitynet.cms.gov/inpatient/hrrp/measures#:~:text=Planned%20Readmission%20Algorithm.-,Excess%20Readmission%20Ratio,-The%20excess%20readmission) in [select patient populations](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/quality/value-based-programs/hospital-readmissions#:~:text=What%20measures%20are%20included%20in%20the%20Hospital%20Readmissions%20Reduction%20Program%3F) during a preceding [performance period](https://qualitynet.cms.gov/inpatient/hrrp/resources). Readmissions also show up in other payer contracts, such as commericial insurers. Thus, it is a key area of focus for hospitals and part of the general measure of overall health of clinical and financial operations.\n\nTypically, cross-functional teams are deployed within health systems to monitor and develop initiatives, interventions, and overall strategy to manage and prevent readmissions. This includes things like care coordination and patient outreach, as well as how to incorporate technology such as predictive analytics to identify high-risk patients and prevent readmissions before they occur.\n\n## The Problems\n\nThe issues in doing this flawlessly are multi-factorial, but we'll list a few that we see relevant to (and motivators for) this package:\n\n* **Reporting lineage**: It is often difficult to have seamless line of sight and reconcile hospital-wide metrics (e.g., overall readmission rates, penalty amounts, etc.) down to individual patients and their associated impact. There are many reasons for this: some may be technical (e.g., reporting tools, data collection, systems/personnel constraints), but some are due to complexities of hospital operations: varying definitions of metrics (e.g., how do we define readmissions?), diverse patient populations (e.g., which patients should/should not be included in the rates?), differential impact on outcomes (e.g., only Medicare patients contribute to the penalty but the hospital cares about readmissions for all patients).\n<br>\n\n* **Payor Contracts/Reimbursement**: Readmissions have different implications depending on whose paying for the service (among other things). It is difficult to disentangle and account for these nuances (especially in reporting/metrics) when developing readmission prevention strategies while optimizing financial health.\n<br>\n\n* **Oversaturation of research**: Readmissions has a [large body of research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=predicting+readmissions). As a result, hospitals are thrown all kinds of \"evidence\" about how they should prevent readmissions, but it's difficult to confidently translate and distill that to a localized, optimized, actionable program for any one hospital, especially when it's conflicting.\n<br>\n\n* **Over-reliance of risk tools**: Especially in the hype of AI, machine learning (ML), etc., there are various vendor platforms and risk tools that purport to predict readmissions. The issue comes with how they are implemented into clinical workflows. These models may be good _statistically_, but must be implemented with intention and cross-functional teamwork for them to actually be useful. AI is not magic! Additionally, many out-of-the-box models focus on predicting readmission risk at the time of discharge. These may be good markers of baseline clinical risk but can quickly grow stale as the patient enters the post-discharge phase where the real drivers of readmissions occur.\n<br>\n\n* **Complexity of government programs**: The [HRRP](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/payment/prospective-payment-systems/acute-inpatient-pps/hospital-readmissions-reduction-program-hrrp) has many moving parts and details that make it difficult to track what's really going on. This includes the timing of the discharges that are actually counted in the program relative to when payment penalties are applied, the diagnosis codes and claims documentation used to identify patients to include, the statistical methodology behind the scenes that power program metrics, and the way all of that rolls up into a penalty percentage amount administered to the hospital, among other things. Each of these details have deep nuances that have tangible impact.\n\n<br>\n\nThis package is meant to provide tools to help with components of these issues. In particular, the current state of the package focuses on the last item, making it easier to analyze information related to the [HRRP](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/payment/prospective-payment-systems/acute-inpatient-pps/hospital-readmissions-reduction-program-hrrp). Over time, we hope this scope widens.\n\n# Examples\n\nHere are a few ways to use the package.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readmit)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## Extracting key dates from the HRRP\n\nAn important piece of the [HRRP](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/payment/prospective-payment-systems/acute-inpatient-pps/hospital-readmissions-reduction-program-hrrp) is to understand the timelines and dates associated with the program. We provide built-in datasets to conveniently access these dates (see `?hrrp_keydates`). For example, `hrrp_performance_periods` provides the date ranges for discharges that are included in each program year:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhrrp_performance_periods\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   ProgramYear  StartDate    EndDate\n1         2027 2023-07-01 2025-06-30\n2         2026 2021-07-01 2024-06-30\n3         2025 2020-07-01 2023-06-30\n4         2024 2019-07-01 2019-12-01\n5         2024 2020-07-01 2022-06-30\n6         2023 2018-07-01 2019-12-01\n7         2023 2020-07-01 2021-06-30\n8         2022 2017-07-01 2019-12-01\n9         2021 2016-07-01 2019-06-30\n10        2020 2015-07-01 2018-06-30\n11        2019 2014-07-01 2017-06-30\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd `hrrp_snapshot_dates` provides the date that CMS took the extract of claims data for each program year:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhrrp_snapshot_dates\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  ProgramYear SnapshotDate\n1        2027   2025-09-30\n2        2026   2024-10-22\n3        2025   2023-10-13\n4        2024   2022-09-30\n5        2023   2021-09-24\n6        2022   2020-09-25\n7        2021   2019-09-27\n8        2020   2018-09-28\n9        2019   2017-09-29\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOr, all of the individual `hrrp_*` datasets are pre-joined in `hrrp_keydates`:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhrrp_keydates\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n   ProgramYear PerformanceStartDate PerformanceEndDate PaymentStartDate\n1         2027           2023-07-01         2025-06-30       2026-10-01\n2         2026           2021-07-01         2024-06-30       2025-10-01\n3         2025           2020-07-01         2023-06-30       2024-10-01\n4         2024           2019-07-01         2019-12-01       2023-10-01\n5         2024           2020-07-01         2022-06-30       2023-10-01\n6         2023           2018-07-01         2019-12-01       2022-10-01\n7         2023           2020-07-01         2021-06-30       2022-10-01\n8         2022           2017-07-01         2019-12-01       2021-10-01\n9         2021           2016-07-01         2019-06-30       2020-10-01\n10        2020           2015-07-01         2018-06-30       2019-10-01\n11        2019           2014-07-01         2017-06-30       2018-10-01\n   PaymentEndDate ReviewStartDate ReviewEndDate SnapshotDate AMI COPD HF PN\n1      2027-09-30            <NA>          <NA>   2025-09-30   1    1  1  1\n2      2026-09-30      2025-08-12    2025-09-10   2024-10-22   1    1  1  1\n3      2025-09-30      2024-08-12    2024-09-10   2023-10-13   1    1  1  1\n4      2024-09-30      2023-08-08    2023-09-07   2022-09-30   1    1  1  1\n5      2024-09-30      2023-08-08    2023-09-07   2022-09-30   1    1  1  1\n6      2023-09-30      2022-08-08    2022-09-07   2021-09-24   1    1  1  0\n7      2023-09-30      2022-08-08    2022-09-07   2021-09-24   1    1  1  0\n8      2022-09-30      2021-08-09    2021-09-08   2020-09-25   1    1  1  1\n9      2021-09-30      2020-08-10    2020-09-09   2019-09-27   1    1  1  1\n10     2020-09-30      2019-08-09    2019-09-09   2018-09-28   1    1  1  1\n11     2019-09-30      2018-08-06    2018-09-05   2017-09-29   1    1  1  1\n   CABG HK\n1     1  1\n2     1  1\n3     1  1\n4     1  1\n5     1  1\n6     1  1\n7     1  1\n8     1  1\n9     1  1\n10    1  1\n11    1  1\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Finding relevant program dates\n\nWe can also use the `hrrp_get_dates()` function to extract relevant time periods for an inputted date.

The current HSR functions support Excel-based formats through FY2025._\n\n[CMS](https://www.cms.gov/) sends out [Hospital-Specific Reports (HSR)](https://qualitynet.cms.gov/inpatient/hrrp/reports) each program year detailing the calculations of the payment reduction for the upcoming fiscal year (hospitals are given a 1-month period to review and submit corrections, the dates of which can be accessed with `hrrp_review_periods`). These reports contain the penalty amount down to the individual, line-item discharges that were included in the program. The package functions prefixed like `hsr_*` are meant to be used with them. For example, we can use the `hsr_discharges` function to extract discharge-level data for the heart failure cohort included in the readmission denominator into a clean data frame:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Mock report from QualityNet\nmy_hsr <- hsr_mock_reports(\"FY2025_HRRP_MockHSR.xlsx\")\n\nhsr_discharges(\n  file = my_hsr,\n  cohort = \"HF\",\n  eligible_only = TRUE\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 25 × 17\n   `ID Number` MBI         `Medical Record Number` `Beneficiary DOB`\n         <int> <chr>       <chr>                   <chr>            \n 1           1 9AA9AA9AA99 99999A                  99/99/9999       \n 2           2 9AA9AA9AA99 99999A                  99/99/9999       \n 3           3 9AA9AA9AA99 99999A                  99/99/9999       \n 4           4 9AA9AA9AA99 99999A                  99/99/9999       \n 5           5 9AA9AA9AA99 99999A                  99/99/9999       \n 6           6 9AA9AA9AA99 99999A                  99/99/9999       \n 7           7 9AA9AA9AA99 99999A                  99/99/9999       \n 8           8 9AA9AA9AA99 99999A                  99/99/9999       \n 9           9 9AA9AA9AA99 99999A                  99/99/9999       \n10          10 9AA9AA9AA99 99999A                  99/99/9999       \n# ℹ 15 more rows\n# ℹ 13 more variables: `Admission Date of Index Stay` <chr>,\n#   `Discharge Date of Index Stay` <chr>,\n#   `Cohort Inclusion/Exclusion Indicator` <chr>, `Index Stay (Yes/No)` <chr>,\n#   `Principal Discharge Diagnosis of Index Stay` <chr>,\n#   `Discharge Destination` <chr>,\n#   `Unplanned Readmission within 30 Days (Yes/No) [a]` <chr>, …\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe could also extract the risk factors for each patient used in the statistical models developed by CMS to estimate adjusted readmission risk:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhsr_discharges(\n  file = my_hsr,\n  cohort = \"HF\",\n  eligible_only = TRUE,\n  risk_factors = TRUE,\n  discharge_phi = FALSE\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 25 × 39\n   `ID Number` `Years Over 65 (continuous)`  Male History of Coronary Artery B…¹\n         <int>                        <dbl> <dbl>                          <dbl>\n 1           1                            8     1                              0\n 2           2                           25     1                              1\n 3           3                            9     0                              0\n 4           4                            9     0                              0\n 5           5                           30     0                              0\n 6           6                           13     0                              0\n 7           7                           12     1                              1\n 8           8                            7     1                              1\n 9           9                           25     1                              0\n10          10                           22     0                              0\n# ℹ 15 more rows\n# ℹ abbreviated name: ¹​`History of Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery`\n# ℹ 35 more variables: `History of COVID-19` <dbl>,\n#   `Metastatic Cancer and Acute Leukemia` <dbl>, Cancer <dbl>,\n#   `Diabetes Mellitus (DM) or DM Complications` <dbl>,\n#   `Protein-Calorie Malnutrition` <dbl>,\n#   `Other Significant Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders; Disorders of Fluid/Electrolyte/Acid-base Balance` <dbl>, …\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe could then choose to extract the actual model coefficients (weights) that get applied to the patient risk factors:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhsr_coefficients(\n  file = my_hsr,\n  cohort = \"HF\"\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 40 × 2\n   Factor                                                                  Value\n   <chr>                                                                   <dbl>\n 1 Years Over 65 (continuous)                                           -0.00589\n 2 Male                                                                 -0.0359 \n 3 History of Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery                0.0199 \n 4 History of COVID-19                                                  -0.00239\n 5 Metastatic Cancer and Acute Leukemia                                  0.149  \n 6 Cancer                                                                0.0126 \n 7 Diabetes Mellitus (DM) or DM Complications                            0.0968 \n 8 Protein-Calorie Malnutrition                                          0.0856 \n 9 Other Significant Endocrine and Metabolic Disorders; Disorders of F…  0.163  \n10 Liver or Biliary Disease                                              0.0865 \n# ℹ 30 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThese tables can be joined together and each patient's readmission risk that CMS used can be computed and analyzed.

The package functions prefixed like `pdc_*` are general functions to explore and import metadata/datasets straight from the website into clean datasets in `R` (see `?pdc_read`).
