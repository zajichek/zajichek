Causal Inference requires us to consider the mechanism of a phenomenon, and think about not only which variables cause other variables, but in what order--subject matter expertise is of utmost importance, and we don't really depend on the data at hand until the very end of our inference process. Causal modeling must become the foundation to do analysis by--we can't just do simple statistics in one project and then think about causal modeling in another--samples are from populations and there are causes associated with why we observed the sample we did, even if we're answering very basic questions. Also, *Bayesian* modeling as a means to performing causal inference is not due to philosophical reasons (e.g., frequentist vs. Bayesian), it's more so because a Bayesian framework provides the most natural tools to employ the specified causal model (i.e., if the frequentist model made sense for answering the causal question, we'd use it). The generative aspect of Bayesian modeling is one aspect in particular that makes it very inviting to represent the causal model in a statistical framework, and apply distributions. Finally, coding is not just a means to employ the math, but rather needs to be treated as part of the product, therefore employing software engineering principles, having documentation, making things reproducible. These things need to be employed if you really want to advance knowledge with confidence.\n\n## Notes\n\n**Overview**\n\n-   Most interested in Causal Inference, focusing on the *science* before the *statistics*\n-   We must be able to talk about causes to obtain scientific knowledge, why else would we do it?\n-   Causes can't be extracted from data; must come from knowledge, assumptions\n\n**What is Causal Inference?**\n\n-   It is more than associations; associations are bi-directional, and correlation is only a basic measure of association;\n-   It is all about intervention, directionality, and the *prediction* of the consequence of changing one variable on another (asking *what-if?*)\n\n**Causal Imputation**\n\n-   This is about being able to construct *counterfactual* outcomes\n-   Asking the question, *what if I had done something else?*\n-   We only observe a single outcome, but we want to know what would have happened had a certain intervention not taken place\n\n**Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)**\n\n-   Nothing more than an abstraction about which variables cause which other variables\n-   Shows the direction at which variables cause each other, but doesn't specify *how* (i.e., effect shapes, etc.)\n-   We can use this to know which things to control for, answer hypothetical interventions, under the assumption that the model is true\n-   It provides a tool to answer very specific questions (queries); not necessarily all questions lead to the same statistical model, but the appropriate statistical model can be derived from the causal model depending on the question\n-   *Intuition Pumps*: Gets the researcher to think about mechanism; great way to problem solve with SME's without looking at the data (which is how it should be)\n\n**Golems (statistical models)**\n\n-   Metaphor for what a statistical model is; it's a very useful machine that will do what it's asked very well, but has no wisdom or forethought\n-   Does not know the intent of the task\n-   Statistical models are just objective tools, but we need causal models to know how and when certain models are actually appropriate\n\n**Statistical Models**\n\n-   Having a flowchart of tests is not useful, except maybe in the *experimental* setting (remember we're talking observational data)\n-   Statistical models/tests don't make a clear relationship between the research and the data; it's just math\n\n**Hypotheses & Models**\n\n-   We need *generative* causal models that are guided by the DAG's\n-   We need *estimands* that are statistical models justified by the generative models (how do we quantify what we're after?)\n-   Introduce real data at the end--this is the easy part\n\n**Justifying Controls**\n\n-   Cannot just control for everything in your dataset like is done so much in current research (e.g., colliders have undesired effect)\n-   Need the causal model (DAG) to be able to deduce what should be controlled for based on the specific question that is asked\n-   *Adjustment Set:* The variables determined appropriate to control for for a particular query\n\n**Why Bayesian?**\n\n-   Bayesian happens to be the easiest approach for generative models; it's not because we're stuck in a philosophical debate\n-   Easiest way to take the scientific structure of the assumed model and generate it, since it naturally has *direction* (i.e., priors)\n-   In most cases, Bayes can be appropriate (sometimes not--cut cake with chainsaw)\n    -   Measurement error, missing data, latent variables, regularization\n-   It is *practical*, not *philosophical*\n\n**Owls**\n\n-   Classic joke: Step 1 = Draw two circles, Step 2 = draw remaining owl\n    -   Programming and technical things tend to be taught this way, but we want to avoid this and document all the intermediate steps\n-   We need to have an explicit workflow with clear steps\n-   We need to treat coding/scripting seriously, not just a means to something (apply software engineering principles, documentation, quality control)\n-   Understand what you are doing, document your work and reduce error, have a respectable scientific workflow, be professional and organized to maintain *reproducible* scientific knowledge, otherwise it's all bullshit\n-   Workflow\n    1.  Theoretical Estimand (what are we trying to do?)\n    2.  Scientific (Causal) Model (DAG + Generative)\n    3.  Use 1 & 2 to build appropriate statistical model\n    4.

Further, one of the key takeaways was that _samples do not need to be representative of the population for us to provide good estimates_. This is profound because generally we are taught the opposite, but because of the process, we can explicitly account for how we know/assume the data was generated, and use that information to create a good estimate of the quantity we are interested in. This is much more _practical_ than the assumptions that are made in a typical frequentist analysis--which tend to be blindly made which ironically makes them more wrong than the \"subjective\" information in the generative approach. We can then use sampling of our posterior distribution(s) to answer questions about what might happen if we do another experiment, etc. (e.g., what if we take 10 more samples?). Instead of relying on asymptotics for the sampling distribution of a statistic (frequentist), we can just take samples from the posterior for any complex quantity of interest and get the uncertainty surrounding that. This is especially important once we are dealing with analytically intractable posteriors that don't have closed form solutions. Instead of needing expert-level calculus knowledge for such problem, we just have to follow the same workflow as in this basic problem. After years of frequentist modeling, that is always full of limitations and disatisfaction in the results, this approach will lead to much more rewarding scientific discovery and confidence in the conclusions of research.\n\n### A check for understanding\n\nLet's go through and reproduce some of the content/concepts from slides but using our own explanation, implementation and interpretation along the way. \n\n#### 1. What is the objective?\n\nThe main question asked in the demonstration was _what proportion of the globe is water?_. Thus, the quantity we are interested in is a single quantity: the _true_ proportion of of the globe that is water. \n\n#### 2. What is the sampling strategy?\n\nWe want to collect data to try to answer the question of interest. This will be done by spinning the globe and dropping a pin at a random location to indicate if it is either land or water. Some initial assumptions are\n\n* All points on the globe are equally-likely to be selected\n* Any given point on the globe is either land or water (only two possibilities)\n* There is no measurement error associated with indicating if the selected point was land or water\n\n#### 3. What is the generative model?\n\nWe want to consider the different variables at play here as it relates to any observed sample we get as a result of the sampling strategy. First and foremost, the primary _unknown_ parameter is:\n\n$$p=\\text{proportion of water on the globe}$$\n\nThe other two at play (under this simplistic model) are:\n\n$$N=\\text{Number of globe spins} \\hskip.5in W=\\text{Number of spins resulting in water}$$\n_Note that the number of spins resulting in land is just $N-W$_\n\nWith the variables defined, the next step is determine how these variables relate to each other. We'll use the following DAG:\n\n\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart LR\n  A(p) --> C(W)\n  B(N) --> C\n```\n\n\n\nThis assumes that the number of water spins observed in our sample is determined by:\n\n1. The true proportion of water on the globe\n2. The total number of spins of the globe made (samples)\n\n#### 4. What is the statistical model/estimation procedure?\n\nLet's suppose we execute the sampling procedure which yields the following response vector:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nobserved_sample <- c(1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1) # 1 = water; 0 = land\nW <- sum(observed_sample) # Number of water samples\nN <- length(observed_sample) # Number of spins\nW; N\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 6\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 9\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nWe just need to _count_ all of the ways that this sample could have arose across all of the different possibilities of $p$, and then estimate $p$ as that of where the sample was most likely to have occurred.\n\n##### Basic (incorrect) solution with finite possibilities\n\nWe know that there are infinitely many possibilities for $p$. Let's first go through this assuming the globe is that of a 4-sided die, such that each side is land or water, implying the only possibilities are $p \\in (0,.25,.50,.75,1)$. For each possible value of $p$, what is number of ways we could have observed our sequence of data? (thinking of the generative process, starting with $N$ and $p$).\n\nFirst of all, we can set our _possible_ set of parameter values, and the number of \"sides\" of the globe this implies (i.e., we're saying that there are only 4 sides and each one is either Water or Land, so we have a limited number of $p$ values that could occur).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Set possible values for p\np <- c(0, .25, .5, .75, 1)\n\n# Number of sides of globe\nsides <- length(p) - 1\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nFor each of the 5 possible values of $p$, how many combinations are there that produce our observed sequence of data?\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Number of ways to observe sample for each p (this is the count of the possible sequences of indicators)\nways <- (sides*p)^W * (sides*(1-p))^(N-W)\nways\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1]   0  27 512 729   0\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nNow, of those possibilities, which was the most likely to occur?\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Posterior probability\nposterior_prob <- ways / sum(ways)\ncbind(p, ways, posterior_prob)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n        p ways posterior_prob\n[1,] 0.00    0     0.00000000\n[2,] 0.25   27     0.02129338\n[3,] 0.50  512     0.40378549\n[4,] 0.75  729     0.57492114\n[5,] 1.00    0     0.00000000\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nIt looks like $p=0.75$ was the most likely value of those that are possible.\n\nWhat is key to note about the posterior probabilities is that they are relative to the total across all values of $p$. We simply found all of the raw counts associated with each $p$ and then normalized them by the total to get the posterior probability. But this process was _exactly_ the same thing as finding the _likelihood_ of the data:\n\n$$Likelihood = \\prod_{i=1}^NP(X=x|p)$$\n\nwhere $X$ is the binary indicator from a single globe spin. \n\nIf we just look at all the _possible_ sequences of indicators that could have occurred:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Total possible sequences of indicators (each one could be a 1 or a 0)\ntotal_possible_sequences <- sides^N\ntotal_possible_sequences\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 262144\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAnd then divide our original combination counts by that, we'll get _exactly_ the likelihood of the data:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Divide the total number of combinations we could have saw our sample, by the total number of possibilities\nlikelihood <- ways / total_possible_sequences\nlikelihood\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.0000000000 0.0001029968 0.0019531250 0.0027809143 0.0000000000\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nHowever, as stated above, this will _not_ change the resulting posterior distribution because the number we divided by was just a normalizing constant:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlikelihood / sum(likelihood)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.00000000 0.02129338 0.40378549 0.57492114 0.00000000\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nSo, we could also think of this problem in a different light (although it's the SAME) and get the same result:\n\n1. We could think of each observed value as an (unfair) coin flip (according to the value of $p$) and calculate the likelihood of the sequence of flips (which is actually what we already did, but this is more of the \"traditional\" way to think about it):\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Likelihood of sequence of observed sample\nlikelihood2 <- p^W * (1-p)^(N-W)\nlikelihood\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.0000000000 0.0001029968 0.0019531250 0.0027809143 0.0000000000\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Compute posterior\nlikelihood2 / sum(likelihood2) # Same as before\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.00000000 0.02129338 0.40378549 0.57492114 0.00000000\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n2. We could also think of this as finding the likelihood of observing the _total_ number of water spins since each flip is _independent_. This is also the same as before, except we're accounting for all of the combinations to observe the total number of water flips, not just the particular sequence:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Make the normalizing constant\nnormalizing_constant <- factorial(N) / (factorial(W)*factorial(N-W))\n\n# Multiply the likelihood by the normalizing constant by the likelihood to get the true probability of the observed sample for each value of p\nprobability <- normalizing_constant * likelihood\nprobability\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.000000000 0.008651733 0.164062500 0.233596802 0.000000000\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Compute the posterior\nprobability / sum(probability)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.00000000 0.02129338 0.40378549 0.57492114 0.00000000\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nNote that the normalizing constant had no effect on the posterior, but it did calculate the correct probabilities of the observed sample. In fact, this was just a Binomial distribution:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# What is the probability of observing W water values in a sample of N globe spins for each p?\ndbinom(x = W, size = N, prob = p)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.000000000 0.008651733 0.164062500 0.233596802 0.000000000\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nThat is, the probability distribution for the number of water samples is:\n\n$$W|p \\sim Binomial(N, p)$$\n$$\n\\begin{equation} \n\\begin{split}\nP(W|p) \n&= \\binom{N}{W}p^W(1-p)^{N-W} \\\\\n&= \\frac{N!}{W!(N-W)!}p^W(1-p)^{(N-W)} \\\\\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\n$$\n\nSo what is going on here? We are after the distribution of probability weights associated with each possible value of $p$ (which is what the posterior distribution is). In mathematical notation, we're just applying Bayes' formula:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation} \n\\begin{split}\nP(p|sample) \n& = \\frac{P(p)P(sample|p)}{P(sample)} \\\\\n& = \\frac{P(p)P(W|p)}{P(W)} \\\\\n& = \\frac{P(p)P(W|p)}{P(W \\cap p = 0) + ... + P(W \\cap p = 1)} \\\\\n& = \\frac{P(p)P(W|p)}{P(p=0)P(W|p=0) + ... + P(p=1)P(W|p=1)} \\\\\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\n$$\nEach value of $p$ is equally-likely to occur (_uniform prior_), so we can factor out that term:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation} \n\\begin{split}\n\\text{(from previous)}\n& = \\frac{P(W|p)}{P(W|p=0) + ... + P(W|p=1)} \\\\\n(binomials) &= \\frac{\\binom{N}{W}p^W(1-p)^{(N-W)}}{\\binom{N}{W}0^W(1-0)^{(N-W)} + ... + \\binom{N}{W}1^W(1-1)^{(N-W)}} \\\\\n& = \\frac{p^W(1-p)^{(N-W)}}{0^W(1-0)^{(N-W)} + ... + 1^W(1-1)^{(N-W)}} \\\\\n& = \\frac{p^W(1-p)^{(N-W)}}{\\text{Normalizing constant}} \\\\\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\n$$\nAs you can see, the combination term also factors out, and the basic structure we're left with is the _likelihood_ piece that was found in _all three (3)_ variations above: $p^W(1-p)^{(N-W)}$. So when computing the posterior probability, they are relative to only terms dependent on the parameter of interest, so doesn't matter if we use the counts, base likelihood, or the probability distribution--they are all the SAME. The counting process and the \"forking data\" approach is simply a means to breakdown the process of what's happening behind the scenes in the math, so instead of just saying \"do this integral\" or \"compute this product of the likelihood\", you're picking apart each step of that process to gain intuition about what is happening. I'd imagine this is exactly the point of the Owl reference in the prior lecture.\n\n##### Full solution: _p_ is a continuous value\n\nAs mentioned before, the actual proportion of water on the globe can be any number between zero and one ($p \\in [0,1]$), meaning that there are \"infinite\" sides to the globe. The derivation at the end of the previous section illustrates that the posterior distribution for $p$ not restricted to any particular set of values. If we pick up where we left off:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation} \n\\begin{split}\nP(p|data)\n& = \\frac{p^W(1-p)^{(N-W)}}{\\text{Normalizing constant}} \\\\\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\n$$\nAll we would need to do for the continuous version of $p$ to make the posterior a formal probability distribution is to find the normalizing constant such that the integral over all possible values of $p$ equals 1. Formally, with respect to $p$,\n\n$$\\int_0^1 \\frac{p^W(1-p)^{N-W}}{Constant} = 1$$\nThis will ensure that the probabilities across all possible values of $p$ sums to one. However, it doesn't actually matter that we find that constant necessarily, because the posterior probability is just _relative_ to the range of values of $p$. So all that really matters is:\n\n$$P(p|data) \\propto p^W(1-p)^{N-W}$$\nWe can then plug in our data and graph the resulting distribution to make inferences about $p$. \n\n$$P(p|data) \\propto p^6(1-p)^3$$\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntibble(\n  p = seq(0, 1, .01), # Approximate the range of p values\n  posterior = p^W*(1-p)^(N-W) # Compute the posterior\n) %>%\n  \n  # Make a plot\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(\n    aes(\n      x = p,\n      y = posterior\n    )\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),\n    axis.text.y = element_blank()\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nAfter using our sample of 9, the probability weight for $p$ tends to focus near 0.70. Note that the scale of the y-axis was removed to emphasize that it doesn't really matter what it is. We would just need to be able to calculate the area under the curve to be able to assign real probabilities to questions like _\"what is the probability that the proportion of water is less than 0.5?\"_.\n\n_Note: In some cases, if we used used a different priors on $p$ (e.g., Beta), the posterior will turn out to be an identifiable distribution which we know the normalizing constant._\n\n##### Updating the posterior\n\nSo when we talk \"Bayesian updates\" or updating the posterior distribution, what does this mean? Since the point of it is to be able to update a model with new information, my gut used to tell me that we were somehow adding our current knowledge about the parameter into the new _prior_ distribution, and then updating the new posterior with an updated prior and only using new data in the likelihood. While in a way this might be the right way to think about it (i.e., if I have a posterior right now, isn't that the most current knowledge about the parameter, so if I want to collect more data, wouldn't I want to use knowledge up to this point as the prior instead of reverting back to the original prior and just adding more data to the collective sample?), in these examples we were doing something different: we're just seeing how the posterior changes as more data is added to the sample (i.e., observed sequence of data points).\n\nLet's start with just focusing on the basic example (i.e., 4 sided-globe) for now. We just need to loop through the observed sample, and calculate the posterior probabilities for each value of $p$ as a new observation comes in:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Set the prior probability (uniform over the possibly choices)\nprior <- rep(1 / length(p), length(p))\n\n# Set the current posterior as the prior (before any data collected)\nlast_posterior <- prior\n\n# Make result set\nresults <- tibble()\n\n# For each value in the observed sample \nfor(i in 1:N) {\n  \n  # 1.

Using the posterior distribution from (1), compute the posterior predictive distribution for the next 5 tosses of the same globe. \n\nOkay here I'll finally acknowledge that the posterior can be written as a [Beta](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution) distribution, which gives us the normalizing constant needed to make it a real probability distribution (i.e., the area sums to 1). It has the following _probability density function (PDF)_:\n\n$$f(x|\\alpha, \\beta) = \\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha+\\beta)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)\\Gamma(\\beta)}x^{\\alpha-1}(1-x)^{\\beta-1}$$\nwhere $x \\in [0,1]$, $\\alpha, \\beta > 0$, and $\\Gamma(n) = (n-1)!$. If we make the following reparameterizations from our set of variables:\n\n$$p=x$$\n$$W = \\alpha - 1$$\n$$N-W = \\beta - 1$$\nwe get:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation} \n\\begin{split}\nf(p|W,N)\n& = \\frac{\\Gamma(W+1+N-W+1)}{\\Gamma(W+1)\\Gamma(N-W+1)}p^W(1-p)^{N-W} \\\\\n& = \\frac{\\Gamma(N+2)}{\\Gamma(W+1)\\Gamma(N-W+1)}p^W(1-p)^{N-W} \\\\\n& = \\frac{(N+1)!}{W!(N-W)!}p^W(1-p)^{N-W} \\\\\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\n$$\n\n_Note that since $p$ is continuous, this function represents the probability density at any particular value of $p$. To get any positive probability, we must integrate this function over a range of $p$ values. Hence the $f$ notation._\n\nLet's quickly plug in $W=4$ and $N=15$ to confirm (at least visually) that this function produces the same posterior we made to answer the last question. We'll do this by evaluating the density of the derived Beta distribution at range of possible $p$ values. _Note we'll have to use the parameterizations for the Beta distribution that are built into `R`_.\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Reparameterize\nalpha <- W_new + 1\nbeta <- N_new - W_new + 1\n\n# Make a data frame\ntibble(\n  p = seq(0, 1, .01), # Approximate the range of p values (same as before)\n  posterior = dbeta(p, shape1 = alpha, shape2 = beta) # Compute the actual posterior density\n) %>%\n  \n  # Make a plot\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_line(\n    aes(\n      x = p,\n      y = posterior\n    )\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-16-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nFrom inspection, it appears that they are essentially the same curves. _Note that this time I kept the y-axis labels because this is the density for the actual probability distribution_.\n\nSo back to the question: how do we find the posterior predictive distribution for the next 5 globe spins? Well, if the globe is spun 5 more times, then we can get water on 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or all 5 spins. Our quest is to figure out the likelihood of each of those possible outcomes based on what we currently know about $p$ (i.e., the posterior distribution). To do this, we'll use our posterior distribution to run a simulation of the experiment using the following steps:\n\ni. Select a random value of $p$ from the posterior\nii.

Another way I was thinking about it was similar the alternative in (2), namely that we are finding the $P(W>=3|N=5)$ for each value of $p$, and then weighting that by the posterior density of $p$. However, it seems like we should be sampling from the predictive distribution in (2) somehow, but if we do that it seems like the precision of our estimates would then just be determined by the number of simulations we run, not the data, which also doesn't make sense.\n\n## Notes\n\n**Goal: Estimate the percent of the globe that is covered in water**\n\n-   Think of spinning the globe and stopping on a point and repeating many times\n-   How do we use that collection of points to come up with an estimate?

Our prior distributions, which account for our baseline knowledge about what reasonable values for unknown parameters may be, can produce estimates on their own. A bare minimum strategy is to choose these such that before seeing data, the output of our model produces scientifically reasonable results--there is no reason to allow our model to produce results that we know cannot happen. Then, our data can be introduced to help guide the parameters to an area of focus. In this sense (thinking of the example of points bumping around in parameter space), the data we collect is really just a tool for our model--the model is the central focus, the data just helps the model go to where it needs to go. Also, the idea that there are no correct priors and that priors are just (normalized) posteriors from previous data, make the idea of Bayesian updating very intuitive. It will be interesting to see in coming lectures how we can extend this linear model framework to more \"real life\" problems with observational data that have potentially tens or hundreds or thousands of potential drivers, and strategies for accounting for the most important ones. Obviously these basic examples are great to build a foundation, but it seems like a huge (sometimes impossible) hurdle to have the time and resources to be able to fully vet out expert-driven causal diagrams and generative models that fully account for all the things, especially in fast-paced environments when everyone is just so busy and there are so many projects to attend to. I'd imagine this is one of the reasons why frequentist analysis persists so much (at least in medical research), because it's the way it's been done and therefore you can get more things done faster, even though in an ideal state a Bayesian approach _is_ the right way to go. Definitely something I've thought about time and time again--how can we balance the rigor and detail needed to construct the appropriate models to achieve better inference while still being efficient with peoples' time? Part of it probably has to do with proving to stakeholders that the inference gained from the \"quicker\" way is less informative (or just plain wrong) compared to the more involved approach.\n\n## Notes\n\n* Statistical models can attain arbitrarily accurate predictions without having any explanation or accurate structure (i.e., the model is just plain wrong, but happens to produce accurate predictions at the right time)\n  + Example of this is a previous explanation of orbit pattern of Mars: assuming Earth at the center (geocentric), Mars orbits around Earth but also it's own local orbit (epi-cycles). Using this model, they got very accurate predictions, but this mechanism is completely wrong.\n  + Orbits are actually elliptical and around the sun, not Earth\n  + Even though the first one predicts accurately, because the structure/mechanism is wrong, it doesn't extend or generalize to other things. However, the correct mechanism is able to explain orbit patterns of all planets in the solar system.\n* Linear regression is a large class of statistical golems\n  + **Geogentric**: describes associations, makes good predictions; mechanistically always wrong (but useful), very good approximation; meaning doesn't depend on the model, depends on an external causal model. Nothing wrong with it unless you actually believe it is the true mechanism.\n  + **Gaussian**: Abstracts away from detail of general error model; mechanistically silent. General argument about symmetry of error. \n\n**Gaussian**\n\n* Example: Flip coin, each person take a step to left or right depending on heads/tails, measure distance from center; makes a normal distribution. Why?\n  + There are more ways for a sequence of coin tosses to get you close to the middle than there are to get you to the left or right\n  + Many natural processes attract to this behavior because it is adding together small differences\n* Two arguments:\n  + Generative: summed fluctuations tend towards normal. Ex. growth--added fluctuations over time, same age weight tends to be gaussian\n  + Inferential: estimating mean/variance. Best to use since least informative (maximum entropy)\n* Variable does not need to be normally distributed for normal model to be useful. Machine for estimating mean/variance.

In the lecture example, the total causal effect of sex on weight was determined by using a (Bayesian) intercept-only model, which showed considerable difference is mean weights between male/female. However, when assessing the direct causal effect, a parameter was added to fit separate slopes for male/female in order to block out the effect of sex on weight that is observed through other causes (in this case, height), such that the resulting estimator looked at mean differences in weight _at each height_--the posterior distribution for this difference yielded little to no direct effect, indicating that most of the difference in weight between male/females is due to height differences. Another interesting aspect of this lecture was how to think about which way an arrow should go when drawing the causal diagram. You should think of the interventions we are willing to consider, and which make logical sense. For example, we drew $H \\rightarrow W$ because, given a height, it makes sense to employ interventions (such as weight loss program, exercise, etc.) that could presumably impact the resulting weight, but it doesn't make a lot of sense to think of trying to change someone's height given their weight. Also, declaring something as a _cause_ of something, generally you first want to think about whether an intervention can be employed, but if not can still make sense if it is a proxy for something else (e.g., age encapsulates time, among many other things that presumably do cause height). We can use flexible curves to fit things (e.g., splines), but we want to make sure we vet out any erroneous areas where estimates don't make sense, and add necessary restrictions to alleviate. So far, these lectures have given great optimism and excitement for how to approach modeling. I want to be confident in the models I produce, and I think the generative framework is the right approach to be able to believe in the results you are producing. I see so much published research from observational data that declare something statistically significant for a given research hypothesis and say \"we adjusted for all these confounders\". Even if I feel fine about the math/statistical procedure, I'm always skeptical about the conclusions that are drawn from it, and quite frankly, don't feel like it means much at all for really making a decision--there are just too many limitations about all sorts of things. The generative approach gives the tools and rigor to be much more confident in the results, and if we can be more demanding of that rigor, time and energy, it should yield more benefit in the long run. I'd rather spend more time getting to a confident conclusion than just pumping out results.\n\n### A check for understanding\n\nDuring (and after) the lecture, it took me a while to gain intuition about what was happening in the generative simulation for the model:\n\n\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart LR\n  A(Sex) --> C(Weight)\n  A --> B(Height)\n  B --> C\n```\n\n\nThe code was written in the following way:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# S = 1 female, S = 2 male\nsim_HW <- function(S,b,a) {\n  N <- length(S)\n  H <- ifelse(S==1,150,160) + rnorm(N,0,5)\n  W <- a[S] + b[S]*H + rnorm(N,0,5)\n  data.frame(S,H,W)\n}\n\n# Generate data\nset.seed(123)\nS <- rbinom(100,1,.5) + 1\ndat <- sim_HW(S, b=c(.5,.6), a=c(0,0))\nhead(dat)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n  S        H        W\n1 1 151.2666 79.57199\n2 2 159.8573 99.75957\n3 1 149.7856 76.55384\n4 2 166.8430 95.06392\n5 2 158.8711 94.72542\n6 1 157.5824 77.38920\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nFirst, the indexing used here `b[S]` was odd because `b` is a vector of length 2, and `S` is a vector of length 100. But all it is doing is making a vector of length 100 by looking up the index of `b` at each spot (since `S` is either 1 or 2). I didn't know you could index like that in `R` but I guess you learn something everyday. Anyway, that was not the real thing that confused me.\n\nIn the lecture, he states that the `a` term represents the _direct_ effect of sex on weight, and the `b` term represents the _indirect_ effect (i.e., proportionality/slope for each sex). It's clear that there are separate lines created for each sex, and you can see the form of an intercept and slope for each one. In my mind, I'm thinking this has to be similar to an interaction in the model, but it wasn't intuitive to me how this really played out and/or there was something different going on here. After some thought on a notepad, it is exactly what I was thinking--just a linear model with an interaction term between sex and height, though it is reparameterized a little to create the _symmetry_ of effects as discussed in the lecture. Anyway, here is how it translates:\n\nCurrently, we have that the sex indicators are as follows:\n\n$$S = 1 (female), 2(male)$$\nThen, the effect of height on weight for each sex is as follows:\n\n$$b=(b_{S_1},b_{S_2}) = (0.5, 0.6)$$\nFinally, the intercept within each line is:\n\n$$a=(a_{S_1},a_{S_2})=(0,0)$$\nThis leads to:\n\n$$W_{S_1} = a_{S_1} + b_{S_1}H + \\epsilon_i = .5H+\\epsilon_i$$\n$$W_{S_2} = a_{S_2} + b_{S_1}H + \\epsilon_i = .6H + \\epsilon_i$$\nWe could think of this as a single model equation with four (4) regression coefficients looking like the following:\n\n$$W = \\beta_1 S_1 + \\beta_2 S_2 + \\beta_3 H \\times S_1 + \\beta_4 H \\times S_2 + \\epsilon_i$$\nwhere\n\n$$S_1 = 1 \\text{ if female; 0 otherwise}$$\n$$S_2 = 1 \\text{ if male; 0 otherwise}$$\nThere is no intercept term in the model. Instead, there are _symmetric_ parameterizations for males and females, instead of making the effects relative to one another (which, as mentioned in the lecture, makes it more intuitive to make priors for). The design matrix for this model would then look something like:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntribble(\n  ~S1, ~S2, ~H_S1, ~H_S2, ~W,\n  1, 0, 150, 0, 80,\n  0, 1, 0, 160, 90,\n  0, 1, 0, 140, 70,\n  1, 0, 165, 0, 75\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 4 × 5\n     S1    S2  H_S1  H_S2     W\n  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n1     1     0   150     0    80\n2     0     1     0   160    90\n3     0     1     0   140    70\n4     1     0   165     0    75\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nBasically, every time `S1` is `1` (female), then `S2` is `0` (male), as well as the corresponding value for `H`. \n\n_I may have to rethink what I just wrote a bit as the the $S_1$ and $S_2$ columns are actually completely redundant, so not sure if this is right yet_\n\nSo how would we parameterize this in a more classical regression model? If we just rewrite a few things. Let:\n\n$$S=(0(female), 1(male))$$\nThen we assume the model is:\n\n$$W = \\beta_0+\\beta_1 S+\\beta_2 H+\\beta_3 S\\times H + \\epsilon_i$$\nIf we translate parameter values from the example,\n\n$$\\beta_0 = 0 \\hskip.1in \\beta_1 = 0$$\n$$\\beta_2 = .5 \\hskip.1in \\beta_3 = .6-.5 = .1$$\nWe then get:\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation} \n\\begin{split}\nW_{S=0(female)}\n&= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(0) + \\beta_2H+\\beta_3 0 \\times H + \\epsilon_i \\\\\n&= 0 + 0(0) + .5H + .1(0 \\times H) + \\epsilon_i \\\\\n&= 0.5H + \\epsilon_i\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\n$$\n\n$$\n\\begin{equation} \n\\begin{split}\nW_{S=1(male)}\n&= \\beta_0 + \\beta_1(1) + \\beta_2H+\\beta_3 1 \\times H + \\epsilon_i \\\\\n&= 0 + 0(1) + .5H + .1(1 \\times H) + \\epsilon_i \\\\\n&= 0.5H + 0.1H + \\epsilon_i \\\\\n&= 0.6H + \\epsilon_i\n\\end{split}\n\\end{equation}\n$$\n\nThis makes it much more clear why the _direct_ effect is zero, since the main effect of sex is zero in this model. We only see an effect from sex through the interaction with height, which is what is known as the _indirect_ effect.\n\n## Homework\n\n1. From the `Howell1` dataset, consider only the people younger than 13 years old. Estimate the causal association between age and weight. Assume age influences weight through two paths. First, age influences height, and height influences weight. Second, age directly influences weight through age-related changes in muscle growth and body proportions. Draw the DAG that represents these causal relationships. And then write a generative simulation that takes age as an input and simulates height and weight, obeying the relationships in the DAG.\n\nFirst, we'll import the dataset directly from the package's [Github repository](https://github.com/rmcelreath/rethinking). We will filter to those < 13 years old, and convert height to inches, and weight to lbs:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhowell1 <-\n  read_delim(\n    file = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rmcelreath/rethinking/master/data/Howell1.csv\",\n    delim = \";\"\n  ) %>%\n  \n  # Keep those younger than 13\n  filter(age < 13) %>%\n  \n  # Convert the units (more intuitive for me)\n  mutate(\n    height = height / 2.54,\n    weight = weight * 2.205\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRows: 544 Columns: 4\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \";\"\ndbl (4): height, weight, age, male\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhowell1\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 146 × 4\n   height weight   age  male\n    <dbl>  <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>\n 1   48     43.3  12       1\n 2   41.5   30.8   8       0\n 3   34     23.1   6.5     0\n 4   43     35.3   7       0\n 5   45     39.4  11       1\n 6   48     45.0   8       1\n 7   50.8   51.5  12       0\n 8   38.5   29.3   5       0\n 9   43.5   34.0   9       0\n10   38.5   28.1   5       0\n# ℹ 136 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\nNext, we can write the causal diagram as described:\n\n\n\n```{mermaid}\nflowchart LR\n  A(Age) --> C(Weight)\n  A --> B(Height)\n  B --> C\n```\n\n\nIf we let\n\n$$A=Age \\hskip.1in H=Height \\hskip.1in W=Weight$$\n\nThen, we assume that:\n\n$$H = f_H(A) \\hskip.2in W = f_W(A,H)$$\nFinally, we can write the generative simulation to produce synthetic data governed by the DAG:\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Simulating synthetic children\nsim_children <-\n  function(N) {\n    \n    # 1.

Use a linear regression to estimate the **total** causal effect of each year of growth on weight.\n\n3. Now suppose the causal association between age and weight might be different between boys and girls. Use a single linear regression, with a categorical variable for sex, to estimate the total causal effect of age on weight separately for boys and girls. How do boys and girls differ? Provide one or more posterior contrasts as a summary.\n\n## Notes\n\n* The linear regression can approximate anything, so we need to design it with the causal model in mind\n* Generative models + multiple estimands, we'll have multiple estimands\n* Need post-processing of posterior distribution to gain inference of joint distributino\n* We require categories, splines, etc. to build causal estimators\n* Need to _stratify_ by category to get at the estimands we want (separate lines)\n\n**Example**\n\n* Extend example above to include patient sex, age\n* Need to determine how height, weight, sex are causally related (add to DAG), and statistically related\n* To determine which way the arrows go, think about the interventions you're willing to consider\n* Don't have to draw them, but the implied unobserved causes of each variable are implied\n  + These are ignorable _unless shared_ across variables\n  + Ex. temperature is a cause of sex and weight in some species\n  \n* What is the causal effect of S on W?\n  + Accounts for direct and indirect effect\n  + We can also ask what is the direct causal effect of S on W?\n  + These questions require different models\n  \n* Generally want to assign the same prior for parameters for each category level (below)\n  + Using indexing is advantageous because you have symmetry such that all parameters can get the same prior, they are all interpreted the same within their levels\n  + Using indicators makes parameters relative to other levels, which causes you have to put priors on other parameters because it is an adjustment parameter (one is an average, one is an adjustment to an average)\n\n$$W_i \\sim Normal(\\mu_i, \\sigma) \\hskip.1in \\mu_i=\\alpha_{S[i]}$$\n$$\\alpha = [\\alpha_1, \\alpha_2] \\hskip.1in \\alpha_j \\sim Normal(60,10)$$\n**Total Causal Effect**\n\n* Simulate one data set of all males, another of all females, look at the average difference in weight\n  + This is the actual causal effect\n  + Then you can generate a random data set, run the modeling process, and then ensure that the model provides the expected estimate\n* Look at the posterior distribution of the mean difference, and randomly draw samples from the individual posteriors and compute the differences to answer questions like \"what is the probability that a randomly selected male will be heavier than a randomly selected female?\"\n* This was basically just an intercept-only model for sex, and the effect due to height would be captured in that difference\n\n**Direct Effect**\n\n* How do we partial out the indirect effect of Height (block it)?\n  + Stratify by height to block the association between S and W that is transmitted through H\n* Difference in intercept, the indirect is slope differences\n* Here, the model allows for separate slopes by sex, so we can tease out the impact of height\n  + Center the height to make the interpretation of the intercept be the average\n  + Makes priors more intuitive, and computation easier\n\n$$W_i \\sim Normal(\\mu_i, \\sigma) \\hskip.1in \\mu_i=\\alpha_{S[i]} + \\beta_{S[i]}(H_i-\\bar{H})$$\n$$\\alpha=[\\alpha_1,\\alpha_2] \\hskip.1in \\beta=[\\beta_1,\\beta_2]$$\n\n* In this case, nearly all the total effect of sex on weight is explained through height (the direct effect (posterior of the difference between weights at each height) is nearly 0 at all heights)\n\n**Curve Fitting**\n\n* We use linear models to do this; i.e., it's not mechanistic, but we use it wisely\n* Strategies\n  + Polynomials: Don't do it; no local smoothing, only global; learn to much from data in regions that lie far away \n    + It's not worth having a model that looks OK for most of the data that we know is completely erroneous (e.g., parabola at some point shows babies get heavier as their height decreases, which we know is wrong); even though this is a small portation of observations, it's still knowingly wrong, so why use it?\n  + Splines & GAMs: Not as bad as polynomials; add total many locally trained terms\n\n**Splines**\n\n* Flexible curve that will find trends\n* B-splines are linear models containing additive terms with synthetic variables\n  + Think of it as a collection of individual curves (basis functions), but the weight of each basis function is non-zero at only particular areas of x, and spline is the sum of the curves at a particular point\n\n$$\\mu_i = \\alpha + w_1B_{i,1} + w_2B_{i,2} + ...$$\n\n* Ideal model for age/height would be to account for what we know about human biology: infant, toddler, adolescent, adult. In the first 3, we expect only upward growth, so we should constrain.\n\n**Full Luxury Bayes**\n\n* Equivalent approach is to use one model for entire causal sample\n* Then run simulations from overall system to get answers to specific queries\n",
