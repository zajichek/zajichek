That was the very topic they were discussing when shots rang out. A couple days after the shooting, Kozak [did an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18FNK6ZNGuo) with [Channel 5](https://www.youtube.com/@Channel5YouTube) where he talked about that moment, context around the conversation they were having, and his argument as to why he was right and Kirk was wrong, which was his motivation for going up to the microphone at Utah Valley University (UVU). They talked about much more than that, and it was worth watching the whole thing, but the aforementioned segment is what we'll focus on here.\n\nI listened to him explain his argument, and in particular the \"statistical evidence\" he generated to prove his point. Now I don't know the true answer, statistically, of who is right and who is wrong in this debate, but Kozak's statistical justification was inadequate at best, and points to a much larger issue of how surface-level statistical machinery are ignorantly used with the presuposition that it itself can determine truth just by plugging semi-relevant numbers into a collection of formulas. In my opinion, it's often willful ignorance that drives this, as, depending on the topic being studied, people will choose to put more or less critical thinking/rigor into the nuances insofar as it aligns with the desired narrative. He seems like a smart guy, and I'd be willing to bet he wouldn't let this shallow argument slide if it was to prove a point he disagreed with. \n\nWhat's missing here is a deeper consideration of the questions being asked, what information is needed to answer those questions, how that information is actually measured and realized, and ultimately what the subsequent interpretation/implications are as a result..so like the whole process of answering scientific questions with rigor. Therefore, I thought I'd unpack this a bit to point out where I see his analysis is flawed, or at least incomplete.\n\n# The Claim\n\nWe'll start with some background to what his claim was and his supporting evidence for his conclusion.\n\nIt started from [an X post](https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/1960755307896037490?s=46) that Kirk made:\n\n![](kirkpost.png)\n\nIn response (to this and other posts), Kozak made [this TikTok reel](https://www.instagram.com/staxioms/reel/DN69cs5Ecab/?hl=en) to facetiously answer Kirk's question. You should watch the entire reel, but he does talk about it in [the interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18FNK6ZNGuo) as well, specifically from the [1:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18FNK6ZNGuo&t=78s) to [2:16](https://youtu.be/18FNK6ZNGuo?t=136) minute mark.\n\nIn the video [he concludes](https://youtu.be/18FNK6ZNGuo?t=115):\n\n> \"...and according to the data it doesn't really pan out that there is a trend.\"\n\nIn [the reel](https://www.instagram.com/staxioms/reel/DN69cs5Ecab/?hl=en), his more elaborate conclusion and \"statistical\" statement was:\n\n> \"We could have 16 [transgender] shooters, and I would still make the claim that trans people are surprisingly, and extremely, non-violent\".\n\nTo clarify, he's referring to the fact that in his curated dataset, he only counted 5 mass shootings where the shooter was transgender. He states that the expected number of transgender shooters in this dataset, if proportional to the general population, should be around 28. Then based on his statistical analysis, anything greater than 38 or less than 17 would be statistically different from the expected number. And, since it was only 5, not only are trans people not more violent, they are \"surprisingly, and extremely, non-violent\" in comparison to other groups.\n\nSo that's the context.\n\n# How those numbers were calculated\n\nI don't have the dataset he put together (where he apparently went through each case one by one and indicated if each shooter was transgender or not), but I'm assuming it went something like this:\n\nFirst, combine all of the [mass shooting reports](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports) from the [Gun Violence Archive](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/) across all years (I tried downloading the \"All Years\" report but it only had incidents from 2022-2025). \n\nIn [the reel](https://www.instagram.com/staxioms/reel/DN69cs5Ecab/?hl=en) he says:\n\n> \"There have been 5469 mass shootings in America.\"\n\nSo I'm assuming the 6000 number is just an approximation, but 5469 is the actual sample size.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nN <- 5469\n```\n:::\n\n\nHe then says:\n\n> \"If you multiply that by .05 [0.05%] you get something like 27. So we should expect 27 trans shooters before we start suspecting that there is a trend.\"\n\nHe clarified in [the reel](https://www.instagram.com/staxioms/reel/DN69cs5Ecab/?hl=en) comments that he meant 0.05%, which was the estimated prevalence of transgender people in the United States. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np <- 0.005\npaste0(\"N: \", N, \" p: \", p, \" Expected: \", N * p)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"N: 5469 p: 0.005 Expected: 27.345\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis 27.345 is essentially the hypothesized number of transgender shooters with this sample size under the assumption that the rate is proportional to the general population. This is equivalent to setting the hypothesis test up in terms of the rates:\n\n$H_0: p = 0.005 \\hskip.5in H_A: p \\neq 0.005$\n\nNow I don't know exactly what statistical test was used, but he did say:\n\n> \"When Charlie asks how many times makes a trend, there's a statistical answer to this. It's if you're above the 95th percentile or below the 5th percentile. So if the expected mean is 28 shooters, we would say that 38 or above would start reaching statistical significance, or 17 or below would also reach statistical significance.\"\n\nSo let's assume he used a [binomial distribution]() to find these quantiles in the [sampling distribution]().\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npaste0(\"5th: \", qbinom(.05, N, p), \"; 95th: \", qbinom(.95, N, p))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"5th: 19; 95th: 36\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDoesn't seem quite right with what's quoted above. It's possible he meant the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles, which would be the typical [type I error rate]() used.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npaste0(\"2.5th: \", qbinom(.025, N, p), \"; 97.5th: \", qbinom(.975, N, p))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"2.5th: 18; 97.5th: 38\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nCloser (and probably close enough). But maybe it was even simpler and he used a [Normal distribution]().\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npaste0(\"2.5th: \", qnorm(.025, p, sqrt(p * (1-p)/N)) * N, \"; 97.5th: \", qnorm(.975, p, sqrt(p * (1-p)/N)) * N)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"2.5th: 17.1215236834714; 97.5th: 37.5684763165286\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere. So anything at 17 or less or 38 or more, which 5 certainly falls in that range, we would declare [statistical significance]().\n\nAnd that's it. That's the extent of the evidence.\n\n# The Flaws\n\n## 1. He's answering the wrong question\n\nAll good scientific inquiry starts with carefully framing the question, precisely, and then designing an analytical approach whose output provides (an estimate of) the answer to that specific question (the so called [estimand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimand)). And, ideally, implicit in that result would be some translation to real, practical decision making or action.\n\nThe question conservatives are asking (and what is implied underneath Kirk's post) is something along the lines of: _\"Is there some sort of higher, or increased, **propensity** for **certain kinds** of violence among transgender people on average?\"_\n\nKozak's analysis missed this mark. Instead, he answered a question like: _\"Is the rate of mass shootings by transgender people across the United States, as recorded and defined by the Gun Violence Archive, proportional to the rate that they are represented in the general population?\"_\n\nThese are completely different things. Sure, he provided an answer to _a_ topical question: assuming his transcribed shooter classification is accurate, then the answer is no, the rate of transgender shooters has been, historcally, actually lower than their representation in the general population. \n\nBut this is not the question being asked. There is more to it than what is captured by simply looking at mass shootings under [this definition](). It lacks nuance or rigor that truly gets to the heart of the concern, which is why people aren't intuitively convinced by it. They don't feel it in their bones. It's just an artifact with no practical meaning. It's an analysis of population rates, not relevant for insight at any individual level.\n\nTo be clear, this is not just an issue in this specific context, it's all over society and science. It's just like the [red pill movement](https://theinspirationallifestyle.com/podcast/the-truth-about-divorce-an-honest-look-at-why-50-of-marriages-fail/), where, because the population-level divorce rate is ~50%, that somehow means that every individual marriage is a coin flip for divorce. As if there is no individual agency, or other nuance involved in the discussion. The same thing applies here.\n\nThis sort of surface-level inquiry, asking questions _related_ to a topic, then finding broad data _related_ to those questions, then declaring checkmate because the \"data says\". It's all just sort of a lazy approach to statistical reasoning without nuance and rigor, which is why most of the time these things aren't convincing and don't move the needle.\n\nThe analysis performed should actually answer the real question being asked in a meaningful way.\n\n\n\n\n\nHe says in the video that Kirk \"has the burden of proof\" since he \"ran an analysis\".it is basically meaningless, because it doesn't actually translate to a meaningful scope of usage. When the \n\n* Just because there is a dataset that is semi-relevant to the context doesn't mean you've declared checkmate on the argument. If that's how you believe science works then you are sorely mistaken.\n\nHe is wrong from the start:\n> \"The only way to do that is go through all 6000 mass shootings that have ever happened\"\n\n* He uses the archive, with 6000 shootings. This list only includes \"those with 4+ victims\".\n* The question being framed by conservatives is not just \"are transgender people proportionately represented on the Gun Violence Archive list relative to their make up in the general US population\". It's more like, \"do transgender people, on average, have a higher and/or increasing propensity to commit violence?\". this is a much broader question. \n* I'm sure they care just as much about an incident involving 3 victims (which would not be on the GVA list) versus one with 4 victims (which is included)\n* Just using his logic of proportionality: state per capita rates differ, so you must account for those in the calculation, at a first pass\n\n## 2. Definitions, please?\n\nWhat is actually being counted here? According to the [Gun Violence Archive](), the definition of a mass shooting that appears in the report that Kozak used is as follows:\n\n_DEFINITION_\n\n* GVA definition\n* Not all incidents are of the same type\n* Care about an incident where 3 people were killed, just as we'd care about one where 10 people were injured. The former is excluded, the latter is not. The data is insufficient.\n\nSo this quote:\n\n> \"Probably the only way to do this is to have an ungodly amount of time to parse through all of the 6000 mass shootings that have ever happened in the history of America.\"\n\nNo, you need more than that.\n\n## 3. The universal proportionality argument\n\n* This ties back to the question being asked\n* Simply looking at the overall percent of mass shootings done by trans people (assuming his transcribed data is fully accurate, and disregarding the definitions of GVA) and comparing it to the per capita population rate of trans people in the entire US population...tells us nothing useful. It's information, but not actually actionable, or guiding. It just is.\n* At the absolute very least, given the data source you have, without having to do a ton of extra work, at least account for state variability (since that is what is conveniently available in his data source) (to be clear, a real answer to the true question would require much more than this, other data sources, etc.)\n  + Surely mass shootings aren't uniformly distributed across the country. Things happen in certain areas.\n  + Concentrations of trans people also aren't uniformly distributed.\n  + For the love of God, at least account for this, at a bare minimum.\n\nI just saved the file (downloaded as of 9/25/2025 @ 11:29 AM CST) in the directory of this blog post, which you can find [here](https://github.com/zajichek/zajichek/tree/main/post/hunter-kozaks-statistical-analysis-is-wrong).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (<http://conflicted.r-lib.org/>) to force all conflicts to become errors\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Import dataset\nmass_shootings <- read_csv(file = \"mass_shootings.csv\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stderr}\n\n```\nRows: 2000 Columns: 11\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (5): Incident Date, State, City Or County, Address, Operations\ndbl (6): Incident ID, Victims Killed, Victims Injured, Suspects Killed, Susp...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n  ## 4. Shallow statistical machinery\n\n  I've [previoulsy wrote]() (among other places) on the issues of statistical significance. Yet it continues to plague the ability to carry out logical statistical reasoning. Let's go through a few quotes from [the interview]() and [reel]() \n\n> \"We can determine if there are some sort of outliers, we can use p-values, things like that, and according to the data is doesn't really pan out that there is a trend.\"\n\nThere is nothing about statistics or p-values that can magically declare that a \"trend\" does or doesn't exist. \n\n> \"We can answer that, it's if it's greater than the 95th or less than the 5th percentile...\"\n> \"Statistical significance\"\n> \"Did you run a statistical analysis on that?\"\n> \"When are we going to start noticing this is a trend? I'm \"\n\nAnd in the video above, he states:\n\nGun violence archive\n\n\n\n# His Approach\n\n* Found the percent of US population that is transgender\n* Found the percent of all US mass shootings (as recorded in the GVA) that were committed by a transgender person\n\n\n> \"There are 200X for cis people than trans people so 1 trans shooter should count as 200 cis shooters...still not enough\"\n\n> \"There have been 5469 mass shootings in America. If you multiply that by .05 you get something like 27. So we should expect 27 trans shooters before we start suspecting that there is a trend.\"\n\n\n> \"And even then, that's not exactly true. When Charlie asks how many times makes a trend, there's a statistical answer to this. It's if you're above the 95th percentile or below the 5th percentile. So if the expected mean is 28 shooters, we would say that 38 or above would start reaching statistical significance, or 17 or below would also reach statistical significance. And 5 is less than 17. We could have 16 shooters and I would still make the claim that trans people are surprisingly, and extremely, non-violent. And if that seems surprising to you, which it might, you need to understand that 6000 data points is an ungodly amount of data points and you could cherry pick any sort of trend that you would like if you just pull examples out. I could find 5 of anything in there\"",
