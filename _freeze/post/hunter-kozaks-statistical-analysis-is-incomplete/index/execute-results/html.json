That was the very topic they were discussing when shots rang out. A couple days after the shooting, Kozak [did an interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18FNK6ZNGuo) with [Channel 5](https://www.youtube.com/@Channel5YouTube) where he talked about that moment, context around the conversation they were having, and his argument as to why he was right and Kirk was wrong, which was his motivation for going up to the microphone at Utah Valley University (UVU). They talked about much more than that, and it was worth watching the whole thing, but the aforementioned segment is what we'll focus on here.\n\nI listened to him explain his argument, and in particular the statistical evidence he generated to prove his point. Now I don't know the true answer, statistically, of who is right and who is wrong in this debate, but Kozak's statistical justification was inadequate at best, and points to a much larger issue of how surface-level statistical machinery are ignorantly used with the presuposition that it itself can determine truth just by plugging semi-relevant numbers into a collection of formulas. In my opinion, it's often willful ignorance that drives this, as, depending on the topic being studied, people will choose to put more or less critical thinking/rigor into the nuances insofar as it aligns with the desired narrative. He seems like a smart guy, and I'd be willing to bet he wouldn't let this shallow argument slide if it was to prove a point he disagreed with. \n\nWhat's missing here is a deeper consideration of the questions being asked, what information is needed to answer those questions, how that information is actually measured and realized, and ultimately what the subsequent interpretation/implications are as a result. Therefore, I thought I'd unpack this a bit to point out where I see his analysis is flawed, or at least incomplete.\n\n# The Claim\n\nWe'll start with some background to what his claim was and his supporting evidence for his conclusion.\n\nIt started from [an X post](https://x.com/charliekirk11/status/1960755307896037490?s=46) that Kirk made:\n\n![](kirkpost.png)\n\nIn response (to this and other posts), Kozak made [this TikTok reel](https://www.instagram.com/staxioms/reel/DN69cs5Ecab/?hl=en) to answer Kirk's question. You should watch the entire reel, but he does talk about it in [the interview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18FNK6ZNGuo) as well, specifically from the [1:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=18FNK6ZNGuo&t=78s) to [2:16](https://youtu.be/18FNK6ZNGuo?t=136) minute mark.\n\nIn the video [he concludes](https://youtu.be/18FNK6ZNGuo?t=115):\n\n> \"...and according to the data it doesn't really pan out that there is a trend.\"\n\nIn [the reel](https://www.instagram.com/staxioms/reel/DN69cs5Ecab/?hl=en), his more elaborate conclusion and \"statistical\" statement was:\n\n> \"We could have 16 [transgender] shooters, and I would still make the claim that trans people are surprisingly, and extremely, non-violent\".\n\nTo clarify, he's referring to the fact that in his curated dataset, he only counted 5 mass shootings where the shooter was transgender. He states that the expected number of transgender shooters in this dataset, if proportional to the general population, should be around 28. Then based on his statistical analysis, anything greater than 38 or less than 17 would be statistically different from the expected number. And, since it was only 5, not only are trans people not more violent, they are \"surprisingly, and extremely, non-violent\" in comparison to other groups.\n\nSo that's the context.\n\n# How those numbers were calculated\n\nI don't have the dataset he put together (where he went through each case and identified the shooter's gender identity), but I'm assuming it went something like this:\n\nFirst, combine all of the [mass shooting reports](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/reports) from the [Gun Violence Archive](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/) across all years (I tried downloading the \"All Years\" report but it only had incidents from 2022-2025). \n\nIn [the reel](https://www.instagram.com/staxioms/reel/DN69cs5Ecab/?hl=en) he says:\n\n> \"There have been 5469 mass shootings in America.\"\n\nNow, it looks like these reports go back to 2014, so I'm assuming the 6000 number he references in [the reel](https://www.instagram.com/staxioms/reel/DN69cs5Ecab/?hl=en) is just an approximation, and captures shootings over approximately the last 10-11 years. We'll use the exact number cited:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nN <- 5469\n```\n:::\n\n\nHe then says:\n\n> \"If you multiply that by .05 [0.5%] you get something like 27. So we should expect 27 trans shooters before we start suspecting that there is a trend.\"\n\nHe clarified in [the reel](https://www.instagram.com/staxioms/reel/DN69cs5Ecab/?hl=en) comments that he meant 0.5%, which was the estimated prevalence of transgender people in the United States. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\np <- 0.005\npaste0(\"N: \", N, \" p: \", p, \" Expected: \", N * p)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"N: 5469 p: 0.005 Expected: 27.345\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis 27.345 is essentially the hypothesized number of transgender shooters with this sample size under the assumption that the rate is proportional to the general population. This is equivalent to setting the hypothesis test up in terms of the rates:\n\n$H_0: p = 0.005 \\hskip.5in H_A: p \\neq 0.005$\n\nNow I don't know exactly what statistical test was used, but he did say:\n\n> \"When Charlie asks how many times makes a trend, there's a statistical answer to this. It's if you're above the 95th percentile or below the 5th percentile. So if the expected mean is 28 shooters, we would say that 38 or above would start reaching statistical significance, or 17 or below would also reach statistical significance.\"\n\nSo let's assume he used a [binomial distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_distribution) to find these quantiles in the [sampling distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sampling_distribution).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npaste0(\"5th: \", qbinom(.05, N, p), \"; 95th: \", qbinom(.95, N, p))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"5th: 19; 95th: 36\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nDoesn't seem quite right with what's quoted above. It's possible he meant the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles, which would be the typical [type I error rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors) used.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npaste0(\"2.5th: \", qbinom(.025, N, p), \"; 97.5th: \", qbinom(.975, N, p))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"2.5th: 18; 97.5th: 38\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nCloser (and probably close enough). But maybe it was even simpler and he used a [Normal distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\npaste0(\"2.5th: \", qnorm(.025, p, sqrt(p * (1-p)/N)) * N, \"; 97.5th: \", qnorm(.975, p, sqrt(p * (1-p)/N)) * N)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"2.5th: 17.1215236834714; 97.5th: 37.5684763165286\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere. So anything at 17 or less or 38 or more, which 5 certainly falls in that range, we would declare [statistical significance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_significance).\n\nAnd that's it.\n\n# What's the issue?\n\n## 1. He's answering the wrong question {#question}\n\nAll good scientific inquiry starts with carefully framing the question, precisely, and then designing an analytical approach whose output provides (an estimate of) the answer to that specific question (the so called [estimand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimand)). And, ideally, implicit in that result would be some translation to real, practical decision making or action.\n\nThe question conservatives are seemingly asking is along the lines of: _\"Is there some sort of higher, or increased, **propensity** for **certain kinds** of violence going on right now?\"_\n\nInstead, Kozak's analysis answered a question like: _\"Is the rate of mass shootings by transgender people across the United States, as recorded and defined by the Gun Violence Archive, proportional to the rate that they are represented in the general population?\"_\n\nThese are different things. Yes, he provided an answer to _a_ topical question: no, the rate of transgender shooters has been, historcally, actually lower than their representation in the general population. \n\nBut this is not the question being asked. There is more to it than what is captured by simply looking at mass shootings under a [particular definition](#definition). It lacks nuance or rigor that gets to the heart of the concern being raised. Data doesn't need to just be what's nicely captured in a tabular format.\n\nThis sort of surface-level inquiry, asking questions _related_ to a topic, then finding broad data _related_ to those questions, then declaring checkmate because the \"data says\". It's all just sort of a lazy approach to statistical reasoning without nuance and rigor, which is why most of the time these things aren't convincing and don't move the needle. And this is certainly not the only place this is done.\n\nThe analysis performed should actually answer the real question being asked in a meaningful way.\n\n## 2. Definitions, please? {#definition}\n\nWhat is actually being counted here? According to the [Gun Violence Archive](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/explainer), the definition of a mass shooting that appears in the report is:\n\n> \"Mass Shootings are, for the most part an American phenomenon. While they are generally grouped together as one type of incident they are several different types including public shootings, bar/club incidents, family annihilations, drive-by, workplace and those which defy description but with the established foundation definition being that they have a minimum of four victims shot, either injured or killed, not including any shooter who may also have been killed or injured in the incident. GVA also presents the count of Mass Murder which, like the FBI's definition is four or more victims, killed, not including the shooter. Mass Murder by gun is a subset of the Mass Shooting count.\"\n\nSurely we can infer that the general concern of violence is not just what is captured by this strict definition. I would guess that certain incidents where one (1) person was killed (like the one that killed Kirk) would be of as much interest to include when conducting an objective analysis of what's going on, although it wouldn't be counted here. Additionally, there are likely certain types of incidents that would make sense to distinguish from one another (as described in the definition). Finally, it's possible that the answer to the true question would consider other forms of violence, not just shootings.\n\nAgain, we don't know what the results of _that_ analysis would be. Who knows if the right data even exists for it. But it's this sort of interrogation that needs to be considered to make a convincing statistical argument.\n\n## 3. The universal proportionality argument\n\nThis ties back to the [question](#question) being asked, and I see it all the time. Broad, group-level rates of some phenomenon are compared with their representation in the general population, and then any disparity (or lack thereof) is applied universally to every individual. PSA: There is a difference between the result of aggregated group level metrics and the individuals that make up the group.\n\nTo be clear, this is not just an issue in this specific context, it's all over society and science. It's just like the [red pill movement](https://theinspirationallifestyle.com/podcast/the-truth-about-divorce-an-honest-look-at-why-50-of-marriages-fail/), where, because the population-level divorce rate is ~50%, that somehow means that every individual marriage is a coin flip for divorce, and people are using that as evidence to avoid marriage. As if there is no individual agency, or other nuance involved in the discussion. The same thing applies here.\n\nFor example, we [already discussed](#definition) that there may be differences in the types of incidents that should be acknowledged/accounted for. [This dataset](https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/mass-shooting) also lists the location of where each incident occurred. Surely the distribution of these shootings is not uniform across the entire country (I just saved the file (downloaded as of 9/25/2025 @ 11:29 AM CST) in the directory of this blog post; it looks like it only downloaded years 2022-2025).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Load packages\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# Import dataset\nmass_shootings <- read_csv(file = \"mass_shootings.csv\")\n\n# Make a plot\nmass_shootings |> \n  \n  # Count by state\n  summarize(\n    N = n(), \n    .by = State\n  ) |> \n  \n  # Compute the proportion\n  mutate(\n    Rate = N / sum(N),\n    State = factor(State) |> fct_reorder(N)\n  ) |>\n  \n  # Make a plot\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_col(\n    aes(\n      x = State,\n      y = N\n    )\n  ) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  ylab(\"Mass Shooting Count\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNote that the population of Texas is ~2 times that of Illinois. Also, the population-level rate of transgender people Kozak used was a blanket 0.5%. But according to [this report](https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/publications/trans-adults-united-states/), it may vary by state. So that, in combination with the unequal distribution of shooting incidents, should be accounted for or acknowledged in the analysis and interpretation of data. I don't know how this affects it, but getting granular, and acknowledging variability, gets estimates closer to relevance.\n\n* This ties back to the question being asked\n* Simply looking at the overall percent of mass shootings done by trans people (assuming his transcribed data is fully accurate, and disregarding the definitions of GVA) and comparing it to the per capita population rate of trans people in the entire US population...tells us nothing useful. It's information, but not actually actionable, or guiding. It just is.\n* At the absolute very least, given the data source you have, without having to do a ton of extra work, at least account for state variability (since that is what is conveniently available in his data source) (to be clear, a real answer to the true question would require much more than this, other data sources, etc.)\n  + Surely mass shootings aren't uniformly distributed across the country. Things happen in certain areas.\n  + Concentrations of trans people also aren't uniformly distributed.\n  + For the love of God, at least account for this, at a bare minimum.\n\n\n\n\n* GVA definition\n* Not all incidents are of the same type\n* Care about an incident where 3 people were killed, just as we'd care about one where 10 people were injured. The former is excluded, the latter is not. The data is insufficient.\n\nSo this quote:\n\n> \"Probably the only way to do this is to have an ungodly amount of time to parse through all of the 6000 mass shootings that have ever happened in the history of America.\"\n\nNo, you need more than that.\n\n\nHe says in the video that Kirk \"has the burden of proof\" since he \"ran an analysis\".it is basically meaningless, because it doesn't actually translate to a meaningful scope of usage. When the \n\n* Just because there is a dataset that is semi-relevant to the context doesn't mean you've declared checkmate on the argument. If that's how you believe science works then you are sorely mistaken.\n\nHe is wrong from the start:\n> \"The only way to do that is go through all 6000 mass shootings that have ever happened\"\n\n* He uses the archive, with 6000 shootings. This list only includes \"those with 4+ victims\".\n* The question being framed by conservatives is not just \"are transgender people proportionately represented on the Gun Violence Archive list relative to their make up in the general US population\". It's more like, \"do transgender people, on average, have a higher and/or increasing propensity to commit violence?\". this is a much broader question. \n* I'm sure they care just as much about an incident involving 3 victims (which would not be on the GVA list) versus one with 4 victims (which is included)\n* Just using his logic of proportionality: state per capita rates differ, so you must account for those in the calculation, at a first pass\n\n  ## 4. Shallow statistical machinery\n\n  I've [previoulsy wrote]() (among other places) on the issues of statistical significance. Yet it continues to plague the ability to carry out logical statistical reasoning. Let's go through a few quotes from [the interview]() and [reel]() \n\n> \"We can determine if there are some sort of outliers, we can use p-values, things like that, and according to the data is doesn't really pan out that there is a trend.\"\n\nThere is nothing about statistics or p-values that can magically declare that a \"trend\" does or doesn't exist. \n\n> \"We can answer that, it's if it's greater than the 95th or less than the 5th percentile...\"\n> \"Statistical significance\"\n> \"Did you run a statistical analysis on that?\"\n> \"When are we going to start noticing this is a trend? I'm \"\n\nAnd in the video above, he states:\n\nGun violence archive\n\n\n\n# His Approach\n\n* Found the percent of US population that is transgender\n* Found the percent of all US mass shootings (as recorded in the GVA) that were committed by a transgender person\n\n\n> \"There are 200X for cis people than trans people so 1 trans shooter should count as 200 cis shooters...still not enough\"\n\n> \"There have been 5469 mass shootings in America. If you multiply that by .05 you get something like 27. So we should expect 27 trans shooters before we start suspecting that there is a trend.\"\n\n\n> \"And even then, that's not exactly true. When Charlie asks how many times makes a trend, there's a statistical answer to this. It's if you're above the 95th percentile or below the 5th percentile. So if the expected mean is 28 shooters, we would say that 38 or above would start reaching statistical significance, or 17 or below would also reach statistical significance. And 5 is less than 17. We could have 16 shooters and I would still make the claim that trans people are surprisingly, and extremely, non-violent. And if that seems surprising to you, which it might, you need to understand that 6000 data points is an ungodly amount of data points and you could cherry pick any sort of trend that you would like if you just pull examples out. I could find 5 of anything in there\"\n\nNow I realize that this guy was just making a short video with some \"gotchas\" to get likes, not actually doing a full-blown research study. And I probably . But this same thing shows up time and time again not just on TikTok but in actual scientific publications, news, media, etc. People just need to do a little more critical thinking.",
