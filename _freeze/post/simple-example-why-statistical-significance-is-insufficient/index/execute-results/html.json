The lines can be summarized as follows:\n\n-   [Left panel]{style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"}: The average sales increases by $104.55 on average for every 10 year increase in customer age.\n\n-   [Right panel]{style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"}: The average sales increases by $0.94 on average for every 10 year increase in customer age.\n\nIn the context of performing market segmentation for increased revenue (or whatever else it may be), these magnitudes certainly matter. Statistically, they don't.\n\n## Some takeaways\n\n1.  Statistical significance only pertains to the *existence* of a relationship (under the implied assumptions), not the size of it.\n\n2.  You must pay attention to the *magnitude* of the relationship to gain any meaningful insight.\n\n3.  The magnitudes should be translated to the *real-world* implications of using the information for different decisions or courses of action. In the example above, the market age distribution looks like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsim_dat |>\n  \n  # Make a paneled scatterplot\n  ggplot() +\n  geom_histogram(\n    aes(\n      x = Age\n    ),\n    fill = \"gray\",\n    color = \"black\",\n    alpha = .5\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    panel.background = element_blank(),\n    legend.position = \"none\",\n    strip.text = element_blank(),\n    axis.text = element_text(size = 14),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 16)\n  ) +\n  xlab(\"Customer Age (years)\") +\n  ylab(\"Customers\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-5-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough older customers yield higher sales, it may cost more marketing dollars to acquire any given individual from such a small segment, ultimately making the juice not worth the squeeze. Feeding estimates into cost-benefit or what-if scenarios can greatly increase confidence in how a proposed course of action would actually play out, instead of implementing things on the basis of mere existence (i.e., statistical significance).\n\n\n\n\n\n{{< bluesky-comments uri=\"at://did:plc:sh3av73hihgu72vx7k44kgv7/app.bsky.feed.post/3lc73zfajos2t\" >}}\n\n",
