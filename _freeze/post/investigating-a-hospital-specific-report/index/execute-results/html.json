See it on the package website [here](https://centralstatz.github.io/readmit/articles/investigating-an-hsr.html)._\n\n_**Note**: CMS changed the format of Hospital-Specific Reports (HSRs) for FY2026 (see [here](https://qualitynet.cms.gov/inpatient/hrrp/reports#tab2)). The current HSR functions support Excel-based formats through FY2025. However, analysis strategies are still relevant._\n\nAs part of the [Hospital Readmissions Reduction Program (HRRP)](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/payment/prospective-payment-systems/acute-inpatient-pps/hospital-readmissions-reduction-program-hrrp), the [Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)](https://www.cms.gov/) provides a detailed, annual program summary report (called the [Hospital-Specific Report (HSR)](https://qualitynet.cms.gov/inpatient/hrrp/reports)) to hospitals that includes details on the penalty calculation for the upcoming fiscal year, such as discharge-level data, dually-eligible discharge lists, cohort-level rollup, and the penalty amount. There is a defined [review and correction period](https://qualitynet.cms.gov/inpatient/hrrp/resources#tab1:~:text=FY%202026%20Hospital%20Readmissions%20Reduction%20Program%20Key%20Dates%20(08/11/25)) in which hospitals can use these reports to ensure the penalty being enforced by CMS is accurate. It occurs approximately 1 month before the new fiscal year, thus it is a time-critical event (see historical date ranges below for reference with the built-in package datasets):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Extract date ranges\nreadmit::hrrp_keydates |>\n  dplyr::select(\n    ProgramYear,\n    dplyr::matches(\"^(Payment|Review)\")\n  ) |>\n  dplyr::distinct()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 9 × 5\n  ProgramYear PaymentStartDate PaymentEndDate ReviewStartDate ReviewEndDate\n        <dbl> <date>           <date>         <chr>           <chr>        \n1        2027 2026-10-01       2027-09-30     <NA>            <NA>         \n2        2026 2025-10-01       2026-09-30     2025-08-12      2025-09-10   \n3        2025 2024-10-01       2025-09-30     2024-08-12      2024-09-10   \n4        2024 2023-10-01       2024-09-30     2023-08-08      2023-09-07   \n5        2023 2022-10-01       2023-09-30     2022-08-08      2022-09-07   \n6        2022 2021-10-01       2022-09-30     2021-08-09      2021-09-08   \n7        2021 2020-10-01       2021-09-30     2020-08-10      2020-09-09   \n8        2020 2019-10-01       2020-09-30     2019-08-09      2019-09-09   \n9        2019 2018-10-01       2019-09-30     2018-08-06      2018-09-05   \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe report file itself (through FY2025) is a large, multi-tab Microsoft Excel document where the structured part of the data is ambiguously placed throughout, thus we need tools to parse it out into a usable format. That is what some functions in the `readmit` package are for. In this article, we go through the tools that are available, what they do, and then provide some strategies/approaches for how hospitals can use these tools to analyze their own HSR's to gain deeper insight into HRRP results and readmissions more broadly.\n\n# The Toolbox\n\nFirst, we'll start by taking a look at what relevant functions are available to us, what they do, and how to use them. For our purposes, these are all of the functions prefixed like `hsr_*`. We'll do this roughly in order of how the report is laid out, and how the HRRP results roll up.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readmit)\n```\n:::\n\n\n## 0. Mock Reports\n\nAs the developer of this package, I don't have access to hospitals' actual HSR's, as they contain senstivie patient information (i.e., [PHI](https://cphs.berkeley.edu/hipaa/hipaa18.html)) and thus are not publicly available. So what we have to work with are _mock_ reports that [CMS provides](https://qualitynet.cms.gov/inpatient/hrrp/reports#tab3) to the public that are meant to mimick the format a hospital can expect their report to be in. It just includes fake data.\n\n_**Note**: CMS changed the format of Hospital-Specific Reports (HSRs) for FY2026 (see [here](https://qualitynet.cms.gov/inpatient/hrrp/reports#tab2)). The current HSR functions support Excel-based formats through FY2025._\n\nNevertheless, these provide a useful playground to analyze the mechanics of the program. We'll start by finding a report with the `hsr_mock_reports()` function:\n\n* Using no arguments lists the various mock files included in the package\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhsr_mock_reports()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"FY2019_HRRP_MockHSR.xlsx\" \"FY2020_HRRP_MockHSR.xlsx\"\n[3] \"FY2021_HRRP_MockHSR.xlsx\" \"FY2022_HRRP_MockHSR.xlsx\"\n[5] \"FY2023_HRRP_MockHSR.xlsx\" \"FY2024_HRRP_MockHSR.xlsx\"\n[7] \"FY2025_HRRP_MockHSR.xlsx\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n* Entering one of the listed file names will return the complete path to the file in the packages location on your computer\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_report <- hsr_mock_reports(\"FY2025_HRRP_MockHSR.xlsx\")\nmy_report\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"/Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.4-arm64/Resources/library/readmit/extdata/FY2025_HRRP_MockHSR.xlsx\"\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow we can use that HSR path with other package functions. Of course, you would just point to your own HSR when analyzing your hospital's reports.\n\n## 1. Program Summary {#programsummary}\n\nWe'll start with high level program results. Ultimately, all of the moving parts in the HRRP roll up into a single number: the penalty amount applied to your hospital. This is typically the first table in your report. We can parse it out of the report with the `hsr_payment_summary()` function:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_payment_summary <- hsr_payment_summary(my_report)\nmy_payment_summary\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n  Number of Dually Eligible Stays…¹ Total Number of Stay…² `Dual Proportion [c]`\n                              <dbl>                  <dbl>                 <dbl>\n1                               186                    856                 0.217\n# ℹ abbreviated names: ¹​`Number of Dually Eligible Stays (Numerator) [a]`,\n#   ²​`Total Number of Stays(Denominator) [b]`\n# ℹ 4 more variables: `Peer Group Assignment [d]` <dbl>,\n#   `Neutrality Modifier [e]` <dbl>, `Payment Reduction Percentage [f]` <dbl>,\n#   `Payment Adjustment Factor [g]` <dbl>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe now have this information in a data frame that we can manipulate as needed:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_payment_summary |>\n  tidyr::pivot_longer(dplyr::everything())\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 7 × 2\n  name                                               value\n  <chr>                                              <dbl>\n1 Number of Dually Eligible Stays (Numerator) [a] 186     \n2 Total Number of Stays(Denominator) [b]          856     \n3 Dual Proportion [c]                               0.217 \n4 Peer Group Assignment [d]                         3     \n5 Neutrality Modifier [e]                           0.965 \n6 Payment Reduction Percentage [f]                  0.0007\n7 Payment Adjustment Factor [g]                     0.999 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThere are also helper functions to extract specific components from this table.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhsr_payment_penalty(my_report)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 7e-04\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhsr_dual_proportion(my_report)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.2172897\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhsr_peer_group(my_report)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 3\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nSee `?hsr_payment_summary` for all of them.\n\n## 2. Cohort Summary {#cohortsummary}\n\nThe overall payment penalty a hospital receives is a weighted average of penalities applied to the individual cohorts. These details are typically in the second table (tab) of the HSR, which we can import with `hsr_cohort_summary()`:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncohort_summary <- hsr_cohort_summary(my_report)\ncohort_summary\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 10\n  `Measure [a]` `Number of Eligible Discharges [b]` Number of Readmissions Amo…¹\n  <chr>                                       <dbl>                        <dbl>\n1 AMI                                             2                            0\n2 COPD                                           18                            3\n3 HF                                             25                            2\n4 Pneumonia                                      32                            5\n5 CABG                                           NA                           NA\n6 THA/TKA                                        45                            0\n# ℹ abbreviated name: ¹​`Number of Readmissions Among Eligible Discharges [c]`\n# ℹ 7 more variables: `Predicted Readmission Rate [d]` <dbl>,\n#   `Expected Readmission Rate [e]` <dbl>,\n#   `Excess Readmission Ratio (ERR) [f]` <dbl>,\n#   `Peer Group Median ERR [g]` <dbl>, `Penalty Indicator (Yes/No) [h]` <chr>,\n#   `Ratio of DRG Payments Per Measure to Total Payments [i]` <dbl>,\n#   `National Observed Readmission Rate [j]` <dbl>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can then, for example, reconcile the overall penalty amount based on what is in this table:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncohort_summary |>\n\n  # Filter to cohorts with a penalty\n  dplyr::filter(`Penalty Indicator (Yes/No) [h]` == \"Yes\") |>\n  \n  # Compute the contribution of each penalized cohort\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    Contribution = \n      `Ratio of DRG Payments Per Measure to Total Payments [i]` *\n      (\n        `Excess Readmission Ratio (ERR) [f]` - \n          `Peer Group Median ERR [g]`\n      )\n  ) |>\n  \n  # Roll up into final calculation\n  dplyr::summarize(\n    Penalty = sum(Contribution) * hsr_neutrality_modifier(my_report)\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 1\n   Penalty\n     <dbl>\n1 0.000746\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWhat we did here was:\n\n1. Find cohorts who received a penalty _who were eligible_\n    + A cohort must have at least 25 discharges to be eligible\n    + Then, the excess readmission ratio (ERR) must be greater than the assigned peer group's median ERR\n2. Find the difference between the hospital's ERR compared to the peer group median ERR\n3. Multiply that by the ratio of DRG payments for that cohort\n    + This is a measure of the volume of patients with this condition are treated at the hospital\n4. Sum those contributions over each cohort\n5. Multiply that by the neutrality modifier in the `hsr_payment_summary()` table\n\nThat's how the penalty is computed, from cohort summary level.\n\n## 3. Discharges\n\n_Note: Because we are using mock reports, the dates in these files are erroneous and thus R doesn't interpret them as dates. However, your hospital report has real dates and thus R should automatically parse them as such._\n\nThe HSR also contains discharge-level data on the individual patients that actually contributed to the program.

Dual Stays\n\nCMS puts hospitals into peer groups based on the relative proportion of Medicare patients who are also eligible for Medicaid. This is a measure of socioeconomic status for the hospital population so hospitals are being compared only against other hospitals that are similar (in this regard). These aggregated quantities were found in `hsr_payment_summary()` result:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmy_payment_summary\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 1 × 7\n  Number of Dually Eligible Stays…¹ Total Number of Stay…² `Dual Proportion [c]`\n                              <dbl>                  <dbl>                 <dbl>\n1                               186                    856                 0.217\n# ℹ abbreviated names: ¹​`Number of Dually Eligible Stays (Numerator) [a]`,\n#   ²​`Total Number of Stays(Denominator) [b]`\n# ℹ 4 more variables: `Peer Group Assignment [d]` <dbl>,\n#   `Neutrality Modifier [e]` <dbl>, `Payment Reduction Percentage [f]` <dbl>,\n#   `Payment Adjustment Factor [g]` <dbl>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe `hsr_dual_stays()` function extracts the discharge-level data corresponding to the numerator of the ratio:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhsr_dual_stays(my_report)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 186 × 6\n   `ID Number` MBI         `Beneficiary DOB` `Admission Date` `Discharge Date`\n         <int> <chr>       <chr>             <chr>            <chr>           \n 1           1 9AA9AA9AA99 99/99/9999        99/99/9999       99/99/9999      \n 2           2 9AA9AA9AA99 99/99/9999        99/99/9999       99/99/9999      \n 3           3 9AA9AA9AA99 99/99/9999        99/99/9999       99/99/9999      \n 4           4 9AA9AA9AA99 99/99/9999        99/99/9999       99/99/9999      \n 5           5 9AA9AA9AA99 99/99/9999        99/99/9999       99/99/9999      \n 6           6 9AA9AA9AA99 99/99/9999        99/99/9999       99/99/9999      \n 7           7 9AA9AA9AA99 99/99/9999        99/99/9999       99/99/9999      \n 8           8 9AA9AA9AA99 99/99/9999        99/99/9999       99/99/9999      \n 9           9 9AA9AA9AA99 99/99/9999        99/99/9999       99/99/9999      \n10          10 9AA9AA9AA99 99/99/9999        99/99/9999       99/99/9999      \n# ℹ 176 more rows\n# ℹ 1 more variable: `Claim Type` <chr>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can see that the row count of this discharge level data matches the first number in the preceding table.\n\n# Analysis Strategies {#analysisstrategies}\n\nIn this section we'll go through a collection data analyses that can be conducted, using functions in `readmit` as support, to validate HSR calculations and/or to gain deeper insights into HRRP results.\n\n## 1. Validating the Penalty Calculation\n\nWe [previously calculated](#cohortsummary) the payment penalty starting from the cohort-level results. However, as an initial validation step, it is important to go through the mechanics of reconciling the penalty calculation from the discharge-level data to ensure comprehension of how it works. \n\n_Note: We'll go the slower, more tedious way to do this in the steps below in order to capture all intermediate details for understanding, but will callout where certain steps can be more efficient._\n\nLet's extract the `cohort` strings we need to plug into various function arguments:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncohorts <- setdiff(names(hrrp_cohort_inclusion), \"ProgramYear\")\ncohorts\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] \"AMI\"  \"COPD\" \"HF\"   \"PN\"   \"CABG\" \"HK\"  \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### i. Extract Discharges\n\nThe first thing we need to is extract the set of discharges (i.e., the _denominator_) that contribute to program for each cohort. To do this, we'll iterate through the different cohorts and sequentially use the `hsr_discharges()` function to get the row identifiers that should be included:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\neligible_discharges <-\n  setdiff(cohorts, \"CABG\") |>\n\n    # Iterate each cohort\n    purrr::map_df(\n\n      # Import eligible discharges\n      ~hsr_discharges(\n        file = my_report,\n        cohort = .x,\n        eligible_only = TRUE\n      ) |>\n\n      # Keep the row identifiers\n      dplyr::select(`ID Number`) |>\n\n      # Add cohort identifier\n      tibble::add_column(Cohort = .x)\n    )\neligible_discharges\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 122 × 2\n   `ID Number` Cohort\n         <int> <chr> \n 1           1 AMI   \n 2           2 AMI   \n 3           1 COPD  \n 4           2 COPD  \n 5           3 COPD  \n 6           4 COPD  \n 7           5 COPD  \n 8           6 COPD  \n 9           7 COPD  \n10           8 COPD  \n# ℹ 112 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can check the counts of these:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntable(eligible_discharges$Cohort)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n\n AMI COPD   HF   HK   PN \n   2   18   25   45   32 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nYou can validate that we obtained the correct counts by looking at the [cohort summary](#cohortsummary) we previously created.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ncohort_summary\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 6 × 10\n  `Measure [a]` `Number of Eligible Discharges [b]` Number of Readmissions Amo…¹\n  <chr>                                       <dbl>                        <dbl>\n1 AMI                                             2                            0\n2 COPD                                           18                            3\n3 HF                                             25                            2\n4 Pneumonia                                      32                            5\n5 CABG                                           NA                           NA\n6 THA/TKA                                        45                            0\n# ℹ abbreviated name: ¹​`Number of Readmissions Among Eligible Discharges [c]`\n# ℹ 7 more variables: `Predicted Readmission Rate [d]` <dbl>,\n#   `Expected Readmission Rate [e]` <dbl>,\n#   `Excess Readmission Ratio (ERR) [f]` <dbl>,\n#   `Peer Group Median ERR [g]` <dbl>, `Penalty Indicator (Yes/No) [h]` <chr>,\n#   `Ratio of DRG Payments Per Measure to Total Payments [i]` <dbl>,\n#   `National Observed Readmission Rate [j]` <dbl>\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nOne caveat was that we already knew there weren't any `CABG` discharges (via the `NA` in the `cohort_summary` table), so we pre-excluded this from our cohort list we iterated through (as it would have caused an error otherwise).\n\n### ii. Extract Risk Factors {#riskfactors}\n\nNext we need to extract the sets of risk factors for each cohort that go into the readmission risk model.

Instead, _all_ discharges were fed into a statistical model to compute the predicted and expected readmission rates for the whole group, and then were aggregated. The actual readmission cases at your hospital were used upstream to fit that statistical model, in a pool along with data from all other hospitals. Thus, the readmissions from your hospital only contribute in an indirect way: they inform the resulting _hospital effect_ estimated from the statistical model, after adjusting for clinical history, which in turn is built into the calculated _predicted_ readmission rate that is computed on each discharge and used downstream in the penalty calculation.\n\n#### Cohorts Aren't Weighted Equally\n\nFirst, remember that even if a cohort has excessive readmissions, they may not contribute to the penalty if there aren't enough discharges. But beyond that point: the cohort-level contribution to the penalty is not necessarily proportional to how many readmissions they had. It also has to do with how many of those patients are seen at the hospital. Recall that we took the penalty contribution amount and multiplied it by the ratio of DRG's relevant to that cohort out of all payments. This means that it is possible that a cohort with a slight excess in readmissions can contribute much more to the overall penalty amount than another cohort with huge excess, if the former is a much more high-volume diagnosis at your hospital. So you must consider the full picture.\n\n#### Statistical Models Aren't Perfect\n\nRecall that CMS fits random-intercept logistic regression models on a combined dataset from all participating hospitals for each cohort. There are tons of assumptions and nuances that go into these models that make them far from perfect arbitors of truth. For example, each risk factor is added to the model as an independent factor, so no interactions between them are assumed. Additionally, effects are estimated on a combined dataset for all hospitals, which therefore assumes the effect of each clinical factor for risk adjustment is the same for all hospitals. On top of that, each of these risk factors is defined by claims documentation, and, specifically, groupings of ICD codes that may be inconsistent across hospitals. Then, these models are used to estimate individual level readmission risks, leading to group-level excess readmission ratios, that are then compared to a peer group _median_ value to indicate penalty--so by definition, half of hospitals are getting flagged no matter what, even if everyone is doing well. We could keep going down the list of nuances, but it's important to at least acknowledge and understand the mechanics of how these things work. \n\n## 2. Understanding Model Weights\n\nAs described [previously](#modelcoefficients), the _predicted_ and _expected_ readmission rates are based on risk models developed by CMS that estimate hospital-level effects so that individual hospitals can be compared to an \"average\" hospital for penalty determination. Additionally, these models _risk-adjust_ for individual patient clinical history as to tease out impacts due to the _hospital_ itself instead of the overall morbidity of the population it serves. Thus, each model contains a long list of covariates (risk factors) which can be explored to gain further insight into the mechanics of the program. You can find more details about the model methodology [here](https://qualitynet.cms.gov/inpatient/measures/readmission/methodology).\n\n### What Do They Mean?\n\nThe first thing worth understanding are what the model estimates mean and how to interpret them. Recall from [above](#modelcoefficients) that we can extract the model coefficients, which are found in the first row of the discharge-level data for each cohort, from the HSR with the `hsr_coefficients()` function, which we previously extracted [above](#individualreadmissionrisk):\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel_weights\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 225 × 3\n   Factor                                                           Value Cohort\n   <chr>                                                            <dbl> <chr> \n 1 \"Years Over 65 (continuous)\"                                   0.00765 AMI   \n 2 \"Male\"                                                        -0.134   AMI   \n 3 \"Anterior Myocardial Infarction \"                              0.271   AMI   \n 4 \"Non-Anterior Location of Myocardial Infarction\"               0.0712  AMI   \n 5 \"History of Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery\"       0.0233  AMI   \n 6 \"History of Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (… -0.0218  AMI   \n 7 \"History of COVID-19\"                                         -0.0676  AMI   \n 8 \"Severe Infection; Other Infectious Diseases\"                  0.0832  AMI   \n 9 \"Metastatic Cancer and Acute Leukemia\"                         0.226   AMI   \n10 \"Cancer\"                                                       0.0440  AMI   \n# ℹ 215 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThese are the weights (coefficients) of the regression equation that we use to weight individual patient risk factors. Remember that these are currently on the scale of the [linear predictor](#linearpredictor). To make them intuitive and interpretable. we can _exponentiate_ them to put them on the _[odds ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odds_ratio)_ scale.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmodel_weights |>\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    OR = exp(Value)\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 225 × 4\n   Factor                                                     Value Cohort    OR\n   <chr>                                                      <dbl> <chr>  <dbl>\n 1 \"Years Over 65 (continuous)\"                             0.00765 AMI    1.01 \n 2 \"Male\"                                                  -0.134   AMI    0.875\n 3 \"Anterior Myocardial Infarction \"                        0.271   AMI    1.31 \n 4 \"Non-Anterior Location of Myocardial Infarction\"         0.0712  AMI    1.07 \n 5 \"History of Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surger…  0.0233  AMI    1.02 \n 6 \"History of Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angiopl… -0.0218  AMI    0.978\n 7 \"History of COVID-19\"                                   -0.0676  AMI    0.935\n 8 \"Severe Infection; Other Infectious Diseases\"            0.0832  AMI    1.09 \n 9 \"Metastatic Cancer and Acute Leukemia\"                   0.226   AMI    1.25 \n10 \"Cancer\"                                                 0.0440  AMI    1.04 \n# ℹ 215 more rows\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor example, according to these estimates, the odds of a readmission for males are 12.5% lower than females on average for the AMI cohort. So one thing we can do is assess these across all factors to better understand how each risk factor is weighted, by which direction, and how much.\n\n#### Relative Importance \n\nA more tractable way to organize them for understanding is to rank them by the magnitude of their effects to get a sense of which factors have the most impact on the readmission risk calculation. Here we'll make a plot of the top five (5) most heavily-weighted factors for each cohort:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nmodel_weights |>\n\n  # Remove intercepts\n  dplyr::filter(!stringr::str_detect(Factor, \"_EFFECT$\")) |>\n  \n  # Rank by group\n  dplyr::mutate(\n    Rank = order(order(abs(Value), decreasing = TRUE)),\n    .by = \"Cohort\"\n  ) |>\n  \n  #

     color = stringr::str_sub(Factor, 1, 20)\n    ),\n    linewidth = 1,\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 1) +\n  facet_wrap(~Cohort, scales = \"free_y\", nrow = 3) +\n

{.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-48-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWe can see, for example, that _Dialysis Status_ is an important factor that shows up across multiple cohort models, thus having heavy impact on program results.\n\nWe can create the full listing in a table format:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(reactable)\nmodel_weights

readmission risks was by taking a weighted-sum of the risk factors in our dataset with the model weights (and then doing some transformations to turn it into a probability). We just established that different factors yield different effects (weight) on the readmission risks from the model side and how that can be useful for understanding how CMS weights different clinical history factors. \n\nThe next thing we can seek to understand is how prevalent each of the risk factors are for your cohort. This is useful for a few reasons:\n\n1. You can compare to see if the rates of various risk factors are similar for your hospital versus peer group hospitals\n2. It gives insight into the difference between model importance for readmission risk vs. how prevalent the risk factor is\n3. We can use the combination of model weights and prevalence of risk factors to understand overall impact. For example, a risk factor that has an average impact in terms of odds-ratio but has very high prevalence at your hospital may have more overall net impact on your HRRP readmission metrics than the most important factor according to the model but has very few patients with it at your hospital.\n\nThe first step get at this analysis is to compute these from your datasets. We can do this by manipulating the output of `hsr_discharges()` after using the `risk_factors=TRUE` argument. Here is an example of how we'd do this for AMI:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhsr_discharges(\n  file = my_report,\n  cohort = \"AMI\",\n  discharge_phi = FALSE,\n  risk_factors = TRUE,\n  eligible_only = TRUE\n)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 2 × 33\n  `ID Number` `Years Over 65 (continuous)`  Male Anterior Myocardial Infarctio…¹\n        <int>                        <dbl> <dbl>                           <dbl>\n1           1                           31     1                               0\n2           2                           27     1                               0\n# ℹ abbreviated name: ¹​`Anterior Myocardial Infarction `\n# ℹ 29 more variables: `Non-Anterior Location of Myocardial Infarction` <dbl>,\n#   `History of Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) Surgery` <dbl>,\n#   `History of Percutaneous Transluminal Coronary Angioplasty (PTCA)` <dbl>,\n#   `History of COVID-19` <dbl>,\n#   `Severe Infection;

you scan through the table you'll notice that the risk factors that have the highest model weight or highest prevalence are not necessarily the ones with the most net impact.\n\nFinally, we could put these in a plot:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nprevalence |>\n\n  # Join to get model weight\n  dplyr::inner_join(\n    y = model_weights,\n    by = \n      c(\n        \"Cohort\",\n        \"Factor\"\n      )\n  ) |>\n  \n  ggplot() +\n  geom_point(\n    aes(\n      x = Count,\n      y = exp(Value),\n      color = Cohort\n    ),\n    show.legend = FALSE\n  ) +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = 1) +\n  facet_wrap(~Cohort, scales = \"free_x\", nrow = 3) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  xlab(\"Risk Factor Count\") +\n  ylab(\"Odds Ratio\") \n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-55-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nPoints that are closer to the upper-right quadrant are the most influential. Of course, it would be useful to add interactivity to these plots (e.g., with `plotly`) as to provide the user ability to scan and view what risk factor each point represents, but you get the idea.\n\n## 3. Other Analyses\n\nThere are many other possible questions that can be answered analyzing an HSR that can be useful for better understand HRRP program results. We'll list a few more ideas here without actually doing them:\n\n### Diagnosis Comparison\n\nIn the discharge reports, CMS supplies the diagnosis code the patient received that led their index discharge to be included in the program. For those who are readmitted, also supplied in this table are the diagnosis codes received at their readmission stay. These can be accessed with the `hsr_discharges()` function and extracting the appropriate columns. Here's an example doing this for the HF cohort:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhsr_discharges(\n  file = my_report,\n  cohort = \"HF\",\n  eligible_only = TRUE\n) |>\n\n  # Keep diagnosis columns\n  dplyr::select(dplyr::matches(\"Diagnosis\")) |>\n  \n  # Aggregate\n  dplyr::summarize(\n    N = dplyr::n(),\n    .by = dplyr::everything()\n  ) |>\n  dplyr::arrange(desc(N))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 9 × 3\n  `Principal Discharge Diagnosis of Index Stay` Principal Discharge Diag…¹     N\n  <chr>                                         <chr>                      <int>\n1 I110                                          <NA>                          12\n2 I130                                          <NA>                           5\n3 I5033                                         <NA>                           2\n4 I5033                                         I130                           1\n5 I130                                          A0472                          1\n6 I132                                          U071                           1\n7 I509                                          <NA>                           1\n8 I5023                                         <NA>                           1\n9 I5043                                         <NA>                           1\n# ℹ abbreviated name: ¹​`Principal Discharge Diagnosis of Readmission`\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThis can be extremely useful to understand (a) which diagnoses are leading to cohort inclusion to begin with, and (b) why the patient came back. Sometimes there may be readmissions that are completely unrelated to the index diagnosis. \n\n### Outside Hospital Readmissions\n\nSince CMS enforces the HRRP, hospitals get penalized for readmissions that don't even occur at their hospital. If a patient is discharged from your hospital and subsequently readmitted somewhere else, it still counts as _your_ readmission. Thus it is useful to understand the rate of readmissions that are back in your own system versus somewhere else. This is provided the HSR as well.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nhsr_discharges(\n  file = my_report,\n  cohort = \"HF\",\n  eligible_only = TRUE\n) |>\n\n  # Keep diagnosis columns\n  dplyr::select(dplyr::matches(\"Same Hospital\")) |> \n  \n  # Make a table\n  table(useNA = \"ifany\")\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\nReadmission to Same Hospital (Yes/No)\n  No  Yes <NA> \n   2    1   22 \n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nFor example, of the 22 HF discharges, three (3) were readmitted: one (1) to the same hospital as the index stay, and two (2) elsewhere (maybe within your system, or not).\n\n### Benchmarking With Other Hospitals\n\nCMS provides access to hospital-level performance data on [QualityNet](https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/). You can use the `pdc_*` functions in this package to explore and import various data files to perform comparative analyses at the hospital level (see `pdc_read()`).\n\n_Don't forget to [subscribe](https://dashboard.mailerlite.com/forms/1517199/154300987644839168/share) to receive email updates when new articles drop!_",
